    "description": "Four people, including three children, have been swept away and nearly 30,000 impacted by flash floods caused by moderate to heavy rains in several areas of Somalia over the last week. [...] The rains, marking a delayed start to the gu (April to June) wet season, have come after prolonged dry conditions across the country, and have been particularly heavy in Puntland and South West States. Initial reports by the authorities in Puntland estimate that 4,500 families (27,000 people) have been affected in Bari and Nugaal regions. Four low-lying settlements were inundated, affecting over 300 displaced families (900 people) and destroying shelters, water sources, and latrines. In areas of Qardho district, approximately 1,500 houses and 11 schools have been damaged, disrupting education for 3,700 children. [...] In Lower Shabelle region, South West State, flash floods due to heavy rains have impacted a considerable number of people in Afgooye, Wanlaweyn, Qoryooley, Marka districts, and surrounding areas. The flooding has restricted road access and damaged sanitation infrastructure. In Wanlaweyn, over 270 displaced families (1,620 people) have reportedly been affected. Stagnant water in displacement sites has increased the risk of diseases. In Baidoa and surrounding villages, flash floods on 15 and 16 April affected displaced people and host communities, and rendered roads impassable. Water levels along the flood-prone Shabelle river have risen. ([OCHA, 22 Apr 2025](https://reliefweb.int/node/4147977))",

According to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), as of 7 April, 33 people have died and 46 were injured due to the overflow of the Ndjili River, affecting 13 out of 24 municipalities in Kinshasa city area. Media reports further indicate that several roads and houses have been destroyed or damaged, power outages have been recorded, and the water supply has been cut off. ([ECHO, 8 Apr 2025](https://reliefweb.int/node/4144934))\n\nFollowing floods, the Ndjili river overflow, and landslides that occurred across 13 municipalities (out of 24) of the Kinshasa capital city (western Democratic Republic of the Congo) over the period from 4 to 11 April, the number of casualties has increased, and widespread damage was reported. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) reports, as of 13 April, 165 fatalities, 28 injured persons, more than 7,000 displaced people (a number of these across four relief sites) and a total of over 60,000 affected people across the Kinshasa capital city area. In addition, the IFRC also reports several destroyed and damaged houses. The UNOSAT was activated on 11 April and the International Charter was activated on 10 April to provide the damage assessment. Over the next 96 hours, more rainfall is still forecast over the already affected Kinshasa area. ([ECHO, 14 Apr 2025](https://reliefweb.int/node/4146232))\n\nSevere flooding triggered by torrential rains in recent weeks has displaced almost 10,000 people in Tanganyika Province, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). This unfolding emergency reflects the double crisis facing the DRC, where extreme weather shocks such as flooding compound the suffering caused by ongoing conflict and mass displacement. The Rugumba River burst its banks, inundating large areas of Kalemie and Nyunzu territories. Homes, schools and agricultural land have been destroyed, leaving thousands without shelter or livelihoods. Stagnant and contaminated floodwaters are raising concerns over the risk of disease outbreaks, with reported cholera cases in the province already six times higher than during the same period last year. The flooding has hit a community already under severe strain. Since January, Tanganyika has received around 50,000 internally displaced people (IDPs) fleeing violence in South Kivu. Many had been sheltering in local homes, churches, and schools\u2014now damaged or destroyed. The floods also wiped out key crops like cassava, maize, and peanuts, worsening an already serious food insecurity situation in the country.

Major cities such as Al Anbar, Erbil, Al Qadisiyyah, Diyala, and Thi Qar were affected, flooding streets, causing road disruptions, and the suspension of basic services, most notably sewage, power plants, potable water, and communications. Due to the severity of its impact, most governorates were forced to suspend the official working hours of schools and universities in order to ensure the safety of citizens. In Baghdad, the heavy rainfall, which measured over 72 millimetres in just one hour, far surpassed the city's infrastructure limits, which can handle only between 24 and 38 millimetres per hour. Residential areas and roads were inundated, leading to traffic chaos and property damage. The Kurdistan Region also experienced widespread flooding, with reports of homes and businesses being affected. Authorities have been working to manage the emergency, but the scale of the flooding has overwhelmed local resources. Heavy flooding was also reported in Babil and Karbala governorates, where main roads are submerged, particularly in the cities. ([IFRC, 25 Mar 2025](https://reliefweb.int/node/4141902))",

Given that this represented a dangerous phenomenon for society, life, property and the environment, both the municipal authorities and different community institutions took preventive measures such as the suspension of classes, cancellation of outdoor activities and reinforcements in risk communication.\n\nIn the early hours of the morning of 7 March, the Bah\u00eda Blanca District, located on the southern coast of the province, experienced intense and prolonged rains, reaching a total of more than 300 mm in a sustained period of six hours. During the morning, the official agency raised the Alert Level to Red, in view of the short-term forecasts that foresaw the continuity of rainfall, with an expected accumulation of an additional 100 mm. The course of the Napost\u00e1 stream, which crosses the city, did not have enough capacity to guarantee adequate rainfall runoff, which caused an overflow that generated significant impacts in 70% of the area.\n\nIn terms of its impact, the flood caused partial and total damage to the infrastructure of homes and businesses, light poles, walls, trees and signs, causing extensive material losses and interruptions in essential services such as medical care, transportation, electricity, gas, fuel, telecommunications and water supply.\n\nThe flood affected the vast majority of the community, both in urban and peri-urban areas, with the most affected areas being those in the east and southeast of the district. Many households experienced water inflow that has reached heights of two meters in some regions, including in the urban centre. Although approximately 50% of the affected areas have been drained, the recovery process is expected to take several weeks in some cases. Thus, particularly vulnerable areas such as the towns of General Cerri and Ingeniero White continue to face flooding challenges due to their geographical location, pre-existing drainage problems and high levels of vulnerability. ([IFRC, 19 Mar 2025](https://reliefweb.int/node/4140605/))\n\nIn northern Argentina, the overflowing Pilcomayo and Bermejo rivers has caused significant floods and flash floods, resulting in significant damage and power outages in Salta province, particularly the Chaco region of Salta. The situation is worsened by intense winds exceeding 100 km/h.\n\nAs of 31 March, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies reports that 2,000 people have been affected.

    "description": "At the end of November 2024, Malaysia experienced heavy rainfall attributed to the Northeast Monsoon, resulting in escalating flooding across nine states: Kelantan, Terengganu, Kedah, Pahang, Negeri Sembilan, Johor, Perak, Melaka and Perlis. The heavy rain caused significant damage to livelihood, houses and livestock, severely impacting the affected communities.\n\nAs of 2 December 2024, the National Disaster Management Agency (NADMA) reported that approximately 137,410 people have been affected by the ongoing floods across multiple areas in Malaysia. The Deputy Prime Minister, informed the media that this year's flooding is the worst since 2014, with Kelantan and Terengganu being particularly badly affected. Since 27 November, a total of 633 temporary shelter centers have been opened to accommodate 40,922 families displaced by the floods. The disaster has claimed five lives in Kelantan and Terengganu, as confirmed by the Department of Social Welfare (JKM).\n\nThe Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security reported that Malaysia has suffered approximately about CHF 1.79 million in losses due to the destruction of rice/paddy plantation caused by the flood. The significant damage has forced the country to increase reliance on imported rice to meet domestic needs. Overall, the Malaysian agriculture sector faces a total estimated loss of CHF 3.77 million due to the disaster. [...]\n\nThe Malaysian Meteorological Department (MET Malaysia) has forecasted continued adverse weather conditions, including thunderstorms, heavy rain, and strong winds, across Peninsular Malaysia between 6 to 9 December 2024. These conditions are expected to exacerbate the ongoing flooding, increasing the number of affected individuals and intensifying challenges for emergency response and recovery efforts. Persistent heavy rainfall has already caused river water levels to surpass designated danger thresholds, posing a severe risk of river overflows that could inundate surrounding areas.\n\nThis relentless rainfall has caused extensive damage, not only to homes but also to critical infrastructure. Roads, airports, and railways, particularly in the East Coast states, have been severely affected, cutting off intercity connections and complicating relief efforts. The combined impact of floods and landslides underscores the urgent need for enhanced mitigation measures and coordinated response strategies.

([ECHO, 12 Dec 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4117766/))\n\nAs of 4 January 2025, Malaysia is still grappling with severe flooding caused by the ongoing Northeast Monsoon, which began in November 2024 and is expected to persist until March 2025. The eastern coastal states of Kelantan, Terengganu, Pahang, and Johor have been the hardest hit, with heavy rainfall leading to widespread flooding, displacement, and significant disruptions to daily life. METMalaysia forecasts an additional five to seven episodes of heavy rainfall during this monsoon season, signalling that the situation may continue for several months. The floods have caused substantial damage to homes, infrastructure, and livelihoods, with roads, airports, and railways particularly affected in the East Coast states. This has disrupted intercity connectivity and hampered relief efforts. Landslides have compounded the crisis, underscoring the need for stronger disaster mitigation and response strategies. Additionally, the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security reported approximately CHF 1.79 million in losses due to the destruction of rice and paddy plantations, exacerbating the economic impact on affected communities. The floods have affected nine states across Malaysia, including Kelantan, Terengganu, Kedah, Pahang, Negeri Sembilan, Johor, Perak, Melaka, and Perlis. Satellite imagery from UNOSAT shows that Terengganu, Kelantan, and Kedah were the most severely impacted, with floodwaters initially covering approximately 11,000 km\u00b2 in Terengganu and Kelantan, affecting 120,000 people. In Kedah, the floods impacted 1.3 million people across 268 km\u00b2, with significant damage to cropland, which persists even as waters begin to recede.

Since 28 January 2025, continuous heavy rainfall, compounded by high tides and the Northeast Monsoon, has led to rising water levels, road inundations, and landslides. In Sarawak, the situation worsened due to the collision of extreme monsoon rains with high tides, triggering large-scale evacuations and the activation of multiple relief centers. As of 31 January 2025, 12,486 evacuees from 3,648 families have been relocated to 62 temporary relief centers (PPS) in Sarawak. Bintulu remains the most severely impacted district, sheltering 5,885 evacuees from 1,649 families, followed by Serian (2,307 evacuees, 709 families) and Samarahan (2,005 evacuees, 670 families).

According to the Nepal Police, 104 people were killed, 64 people have gone missing, and 73 people have been injured. In Kathmandu Valley alone, 37 people were killed by landslides and flash floods. At least 1,545 families are displaced. Security forces have been mobilized for ongoing search and rescue operations. The municipality, National Red Cross Society, and civil societies are responding to the affected population. Landslides have blocked many highways, and the roads reaching Kathmandu, the capital city are all blocked. ([ECHO, 29 Sep 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4097674))\n\nThe death toll and damage caused by heavy rain that has resulted in flooding and landslides in central and western Nepal is increasing. According to media, as of 30 September, at least 193 people died, including 34 in the capital Kathmandu, 31 are still missing, and 96 have been injured. In addition, three highways have been blocked by landslides isolating Kathmandu, and schools have been closed. ([ECHO, 30 Sep 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4097835))\n\nAccording to media reports, as of 1 October, 217 people died, including 35 due to a landslide in Dhading district, in Bagmati province, southern Nepal. National authorities and Save the Children report that 111 people have been injured, 4,000 have been rescued, a total of 540 people have been displaced, and 5,000 have been affected. In addition, more than 54 schools and four bridges have been damaged, and 23 highways have been affected.  ([ECHO, 1 Oct 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4098189))\n\nThe rainfall recorded on 26 and 27 September has been identified as the heaviest ever recorded in Nepal's history. In response, the Nepal Red Cross Society (NRCS) activated its Simplified Early Action Protocol (sEAP) following a decision made during the advisory committee meeting (comprising NRCS and IFRC representatives) on 26 September. The sEAP was triggered to support communities living in the Babai and West Rapati river basins in the western part of the country. ([IFRC, 3 Oct 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4098960))\n\nOne week after the onset of heavy rainfall in Nepal, more than 81,000 people are estimated to be affected by floods and landslides. It is estimated that more than 230 people, including 55 children (20 girls and 35 boys) have died, with many others injured or reported missing. An estimated 4,667 houses are fully destroyed while 5,310 houses are partially damaged. Landslides and rubble have blocked major roads into the Katmandu Valley, hampering access to goods and critical services, including healthcare. Reports of increase in food prices and other essential items in the valley have begun. Access to critical services is affected, with 62 health facilities, 550 water supply systems, and 9,000 sanitation facilities damaged. UNICEF is concerned about possible disease outbreaks, including cholera and dengue fever. More than 190 schools have been damaged, affecting 23,000 students.

The estimated damage includes NPR 4.35 billion to energy infrastructure, NPR 2.5 billion to roads and bridges, and over NPR 6 billion to agriculture. Hydropower projects, schools, health facilities, and communications have been severely affected across impacted areas. [...] While the floodwater in affected areas is receding, the risk of communicable disease outbreaks is heightened, including waterborne (Acute Gastroenteritis, Cholera, Hepatitis-A/E), rodent-borne (Leptospirosis), vector-borne (Dengue, Malaria), and vaccine-preventable diseases (Tetanus, Measles). Overcrowding in displacement camps also raises concerns about COVID-19 and Influenza outbreaks, while health service disruptions may impact treatment for TB, HIV, and other diseases. ([UN RC Nepal, 7 Oct 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4099545/))\n\nThe humanitarian impact has increased following widespread floods and landslides that have affected several parts of Nepal since 26 September.

The Nepal Government has declared 71 municipalities across 20 districts as disaster crisis/emergency zones due to the severe impacts of landslides and floods. ([Govt. of Nepal, 16 Oct 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4103889))\n\nAs of 5 November 2024, the Nepal Red Cross Society (NRCS) conducted a detailed assessment in 6 of the most affected and targeted districts namely, Kavre Palanchowk, Sindhuli, Lalitpur, Makwanpur, Ramechhhap and Panchthar in October 2024. The teams on the ground have reported more than 5,300 households (approximately 26,500 people) across these districts have been affected. Due to the severe impact of the floods and landslides, the affected families still do not have access to basic services like water, transportation, communication and electricity services have not been restored in some of the remote areas. According to the NRCS District Chapters, most of the displaced families are staying in the rented houses, few of them are still living under tarpaulin or with their relatives.

Over 200 rivers overflowed, with Northern Moravia, particularly Jesen\u00edk, Opava, and Ostrava, among the hardest-hit areas. The rain totals in parts of Jesen\u00edk exceeded 500 mm (20 inches), surpassing previous flood records. Roads, railways, and bridges suffered extensive damage, especially in Ostrava, where train services were suspended. These regions experienced severe flooding, leading to the destruction of homes and infrastructure. Thousands of people were evacuated, and approximately 250,000 were left without electricity. [...] The situation remains critical in parts of the South Bohemian Region, where ongoing threats of further flooding persist. As of 19 September, five fatalities were reported, along with widespread displacement of about 10,000 residents. ([IFRC, 25 Sep 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4097173/))\n\nHeavy rains brought by Storm Boris have caused severe flooding in southwestern **Poland**, particularly affecting the voivodeships of Dolnoslaskie, Opolskie, Slaskie, and Malopolskie. Rivers like the Morawka have overflowed, and some dams have collapsed, leading to widespread flooding. On 16 September, the Council of Ministers declared a \"state of natural disaster\" for a period of 30 days in parts of the Lower Silesian, Opole, and Silesian voivodeships. [...] As of 19 September 2024, seven people have been confirmed dead due to the flooding. The Prime Minister's Office reported that the disaster has directly affected 57,000 people, with 6,544 residents evacuated as waters continue to rise. ([IFRC, 26 Sep 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4097267))\n\nThe 2024 Central European floods in **Romania** were triggered by Storm Boris, which brought torrential rains to the counties of Gala\u021bi and Vaslui on 14 September. In less than 24 hours, over 150 mm of rainfall per square meter caused ash floods in several areas. Gala\u021bi was the hardest hit, with flood waters reaching depths of 1.5 to 2 meters in the localities of Cudalbi, Cuza-Vod\u0103, Pechea, Slobozia-Conachi, Tudor Vladimirescu, and Costache Negri. In Vaslui, the southern localities of Zorleni, Grivi\u021ba, and Trestiana were most affected. The floods caused widespread destruction, severely damaging infrastructure such as roads, bridges, power systems, and schools. More than 6,000 homes were either damaged or destroyed across both counties. Around 400 people remain displaced and are currently being sheltered in temporary housing provided by authorities. Tragically, seven deaths have been confirmed.

According to UN OCHA, as of 29 July, 8,700 people have been affected in the aforementioned town. Regional authorities are coordinating the response for those affected by the floods. ([ECHO, 31 Jul 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4082500))\n\nHydro-climatic forecasts for the 2024 rainy season indicate a high risk of flooding in several regions of Mali, particularly in the basins of the Niger and Senegal rivers. Mali is already experiencing the effects of these floods. In some areas, dams have been opened due to rising water levels. According to these meteorological data, the likelihood of heavy rainfall will continue over the coming weeks, indicating a significant risk of flooding. Alerts received from ACMAD and technical agencies in Mali demonstrate a strong probability of flooding in various regions, with a peak expected in August, which is typically the rainiest month. The risk is particularly acute in areas prone to severe flooding, such as the Inner Niger Delta and the basins of the Bani and Senegal rivers, including Mopti, Sikasso, and Segou, which are currently on alert following forecasts of heavy rains since the end of July ... In addition to the opened dams in the country to release excess water flow, heavy rainfall has been recorded in Bla (S\u00e9gou) since July 22, 2024, leading to flooding in the districts of Flaw\u00e8r\u00e8, Bakaribougou, Noum\u00e9a, and Bl\u00e9la. These floods have damaged homes, latrines, and wells, resulting in material losses and impacts on livelihoods. The flooding has caused considerable damage to local infrastructure: 380 homes have collapsed, 165 latrines have been destroyed, and 128 wells have been damaged. Significant losses of food and livestock reserves have also been reported. Responders have mobilized to address emergency needs according to the response plan established by the authorities. ([IFRC, 4 Aug 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4085726))\n\nThe Government of Mali has declared a national disaster following floods that have claimed 30 lives and affected 47,374 people since the start of the rainy season. ([OCHA, 2 Sep 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4090699))\n\nAs of 9 September, the floods have worsened considerably in all 19 of Mali\u2019s regions. The regions of S\u00e9gou (39,245), Timbuktu (36,317), Gao (19,238), Bamako (17,127), and Mopti (1,782) have recorded the highest number of people affected. There have been 374 incidences of flooding and 29,644 buildings have collapsed across Mali. ([UNICEF, 16 Sep 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4094297))\n\nSince the beginning of September, heavy rains and the Niger river\u2019s rising water levels have caused significant flooding throughout the country. Almost all of Mali's 20 regions have been affected by flooding to varying extents. The area's most severely impacted included Timbuktu, where estimated 37,173 individuals have been affected, S\u00e9gou, with 71,882 individuals impacted, and the Bamako district which has seen 16,234 affected individuals. Across the country, 110 schools were reported to be used as shelters for those displaced by the floods, and 35 health centers incurred damages.

Torrential rainfall has caused rivers to overflow, displacing communities and disrupting access to essential services. As of 10 September, the government has recorded 164,000 houses destroyed, five million hectares inundated (including 400,000 hectares of croplands, of which 259,000 are completely destroyed), and 66,700 livestock washed away.

    "description": "Humanitarian partners expect floods in the second half of 2024, with a peak from September to December. This is compatible with the 4-month lead time expected between the Eastern Nile Lakes peak. However, humanitarian needs will likely arise before that date as the flooding progressively increases, thus SRCS expects to start response operations in the weeks before September. Following the alerts from IGAD Climate Prediction and Applications Centre of the high probability of wetter-than-usual conditions in South Sudan for the current rainy season, together with the highest ever recorded in the history of Lake Victoria and the incoming water pressure over the Jinja Dam in Uganda, the South Sudan Ministry of Water Resources and Irrigation together with the Ministry of Humanitarian Assistance are expecting unprecedented floods over large areas of the country. Similar scenarios are also projected by major UN partners in the country, as well as independent experts, with the seasonal flood extent minimum reached in May, which was similar to the minima of recent seasons and the above-average rainfall in South Sudan will likely feed itself into the flood extent and reduce evaporation losses. ([IFRC, 1 Aug 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4083163))\n\nContinuous heavy rains since May, combined with controlled water releases from Lake Victoria, have significantly raised Nile River levels, affecting up to 472,000 people across 26 of South Sudan's 78 counties and Abyei Administrative Area. The floods have devastated homes, destroyed crops, disrupted education and health services, and restricted access to essential facilities. ([OCHA, 30 Aug 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4091161))\n\nAs of 12 September, flooding has affected over 735,000 people across 38 of South Sudan\u2019s 78 counties and the Abyei Administrative Area. According to the International Organization for Migration (IOM), 65,000 people have been displaced, with over 41,000 in Warrap State alone. The United Nations Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) has allocated $10 million to aid 700,000 flood-affected people in five severely impacted counties. The South Sudan Humanitarian Fund (SSHF) allocated $5 million to complement this effort. ([OCHA, 12 Sep 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4093561))\n\nFlooding has affected over 890,000 people across the country. The latest increase is attributed to newly confirmed numbers of affected people in the Abyei Administrative Area, Western Bahr el Ghazal and Lakes states. About 226,000 people are flood-displaced, including 114,480 reported from Unity State alone. Due to damaged and impassable roads, physical access to affected communities remains a challenge.

According to UN OCHA, 18 people died, almost 4,000 people were affected, 329 houses were damaged and eight schools were destroyed. ([ECHO, 19 Jun 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4071456))\n\n*Niger is experiencing its worst flooding since 2020* As of 29 July, heavy rains affected more than 63,000 people across the country, resulting in 71 deaths, according to the authorities. Damages include 5,421 houses and 32 classrooms destroyed and 11,584 dead livestock. In 2023 more than 26,200 people were affected during the same period, with 19 deaths. The 2024 floods are the worst compared to the last four years. Humanitarian response efforts remain insufficient to address the growing needs. Shelter, non-food items, and food, particularly sugar, salt, and oil, are in critical shortage. While the government has provided cereals, significant gaps persist. To mitigate the impact of future flood, the government is collaborating with partners to establish early warning systems, identify high-risk areas, and enhance community disaster preparedness. ([OCHA, 5 Aug 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4084233))\n\nSince the heavy rains started at the end of July 2024 that continued through September, the toll of flooding in Niger has continued to worsen. The country's precarious socio-economic conditions exacerbate the vulnerability of its population too, particularly those living in refugee camps, peripheral neighbourhoods, flood-prone areas and densely populated urban zones... A meeting on flood management chaired by Niger's Prime Minister also found that as of 13 September 2024, 125,772 households - representing 924,799 individuals - have been affected. A total of 95,028 homes have been destroyed, 309 people have lost their lives and approximately 21,145 tonnes of food have been lost in the affected regions, further worsening the plight of the population. Additionally, 13,289 hectares of crops have been wiped out and 17,979 head of livestock have perished. ([IFRC, 19 Sep 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4095359))",

    "description": "Flash floods caused by heavy rainfall swept through Iraq\u2019s Dohuk governorate on Tuesday 19 March. As per the Civil Defense Directorate spokesperson, heavy rains caused water inundation across the city, leading to transportation disruptions, and raising concerns about potential floodings, as forecasted by the regional meteorology department. In addition, the mudslides rush down to the roads and Duhok city suffers severe floods. This is caused by the receiving of 80 mm rainwater on Thursday in many districts across the KRI, and more rains are forecasted in the country. Current torrential rains and flooding also caused damage to pavements and road infrastructure. According to the authorities, 16 villages are affected by the floods and have been cut off from the main city due to the blockage of roads. Government authorities are responding and evacuating residents in areas prone to landslides and flash floodings. Heavy floods have also been reported in Erbil city.\n\nThe provinces of Diyala, Wassit and Maysan, due to their proximity to neighbouring Iran, also witnessed flooding in the past. The current rain spell resulted in small scale losses due to the flow of floods in the outskirts of Diyala governorate, Baldrouz and Al-Muqdadiyah provinces, where two families are affected. In Maysan, the torrential rains continue and floods flow in the outskirts of the province in rural areas. [...] Based on the initial assessment as reported by the Iraqi Red Crescent Society, an estimated number of 921 households were affected in Dohuk and Erbil governorates.

    "description": "In the early hours of 3 March the Capital Department of the Province of Corrientes experienced a deluge of intense and prolonged rainfall, totaling over 300 mm within a span of less than 12 hours. This event set a historical record for the city and resulted in significant impacts in the City of Corrientes, including flooded streets and numerous homes submerged. The flooding affected a vast majority of the community, both in urban and suburban areas. Many households experienced water ingress ranging from 20 cm to 2 meters, even in the urban core. Although approximately 90% of the affected areas have been drained, initial recovery efforts are focused on cleaning, disinfection, and recovering lost belongings, a process expected to take several days in some instances. Particularly vulnerable areas such as the neighborhoods of Ciudades Correntinas, Quintana, R\u00edo Paran\u00e1, Anah\u00ed, La Olla, Ponce, Jard\u00edn, San Ignacio, Santa Rita Sur, Esperanza, and Molina Punta continue to face challenges due to geographical location, pre-existing drainage issues, and high levels of vulnerability. In the initial hours of the event, the local emergency response system encountered difficulties reaching affected areas due to the severity of the storm. However, rescue efforts intensified throughout the day, mobilizing more than 2,500 individuals, including municipal personnel, Civil Defense teams, federal forces, civil society organizations, and with support from the Argentine Red Cross. It is estimated that approximately 5,000 people have evacuated voluntarily, with 996 individuals relocated to temporary shelters. Although the number of evacuees has gradually decreased, some individuals still remain in official temporary shelters as of March 7. Meanwhile, many families have begun returning to their homes or seeking accommodation with relatives and neighbors.  ([IFRC, 18 Mar 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4047505))",

    "description": "The Republic of Congo is facing severe floods since the past weeks. On 29th December, the Government conveyed an emergency meeting with country partners following the unprecedented increase of the Congo River and its main tributaries. The impact of the floods is significant, with around 189,000 people reported affected on 7th to 320,891 as of 29th December from a statement provided by the Government, with people directly impacted by the floods, subject to displacement and severe losses as a result of this catastrophe. The worst-affected departments are Likouala, Sangha, Cuvette, Plateaux, Niari, Brazzaville and Pointe-Noire (heavy rains), with 361 villages and 36 neighborhoods submerged due to the exceptional flooding of the Congo River and its tributaries over the past sixty years.\n\nThe impact of the rains to date on the population already far exceeds the number of people affected over the OND period during floods in 2021 (164,679 people - evaluation with the Government) and 2022 (222,000 people). Heavy rains being expected until March, the situation is worrying and the Government called partners for support. The Congolese Red Cross (CRC) as a main partner is mobilized to scale-up the support already engaged in coordination with the Government.\n\nAccording to experts, the rainfall is twice as heavy as the usual average. The deadly floods and heavy rains continue. According to the same source, the floods caused 17 deaths in the departments of Likouala, Plateaux, Brazzaville and Pointe-Noire. 6 people were reported missing in the Likouala and Cuvette departments. In all, more than 2,292 hectares of farmland were flooded. ([IFRC, 16 Jan 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4030201/))\n\nWater levels continue to recede in all affected areas. This withdrawal of water increases the need for disinfection and cleaning of flooded structures, in particular schools, health structures and water points. During this period of recession, there is also a risk of increased epidemiological risks and the spread of water-borne diseases which further increase the vulnerability of children and affected communities.

    "description": "Since 17 November, a tropical depression has been bringing heavy rainfall, flooding and landslides to the Dominican Republic. According to the country\u2019s Emergency Operations Centre, the extreme weather has left at least 21 people dead and forced more than 13,000 people to evacuate. At least 15 electricity circuits and 115 aqueducts have been affected, causing disruptions in electricity service for more than 150,000 people and water service for some 1.8 million people. The National Institute of Drinking Water and Sewage and EDESUR are working to restore their respective services in the affected areas. \n\nAccording to preliminary reports, more than 1,500 homes, 6 roads and 5 bridges have been affected. Some 19 communities remain cut off due to the overflow of rivers. Fourteen provinces (Pedernales, San Juan, Barahona, Azua, San Jos\u00e9 de Ocoa, Bahoruco, Independencia, El\u00edas Pi\u00f1a, San Crist\u00f3bal, Peravia, S\u00e1nchez Ram\u00edrez, El Distrito Nacional, Santo Domingo and Duarte) across the country remain at a red alert level due to the risk of further flooding and landslides. Heavy rainfall is forecast to continue through until 20 November. ([OCHA, 20 Nov 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/4016404/))\n\nAs of 21 November, severe rains and subsequent flooding have left 24 people dead, displaced nearly 18,000 people, affected 3,500 homes, and cut off some 45 communities. About 1.1 million people are still without access to safe water. [...]  The UN is also helping the Ministry of Health with the procurement of 50,000 cholera vaccine doses after authorities detected 16 cases, 12 among Haitian migrants. There are concerns that damages to water management systems may aggravate an ongoing dengue outbreak that has led to 12,000 cases so far in 2023. ([OCHA, 27 Nov 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/4018104/))\n\nAccording to [information from 22 November], 7,412 homes were affected, 14 partially affected and 22 were destroyed. At least 37,060 people were displaced to safe areas and 55 communities are isolated. A total of 4 shelters were opened, housing 158 people, and 59 water services were affected, of which 55 are inoperable. ([PAHO, 28 Nov 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/4018415/))\n\nAlmost three weeks after intense rainfall and flooding hit the Dominican Republic on 17 and 18 November, a Damage and Needs Assessment conducted in North Santo Domingo and the province of Duarte indicates that populations in the most affected communities require food, clean water, hygiene and sanitation supplies, medicines, and the repair or reconstruction of homes. \n\nAccording to estimations from the government\u2019s social protection system (SIUBEN), the flooding affected at least 340,000 people in the provinces of Duarte, Santo Domingo, San Jos\u00e9 de Ocoa, Barahona, Bahoruco, San Juan de la Maguana, S\u00e1nchez Ram\u00edrez, Peravia, Azua, Distrito Nacional and San Crist\u00f3bal. Some 34 people died, 37,000 were displaced and approximately 7,412 homes were severely damaged. Around 61 per cent of damaged homes were in the province of Duarte, while 13 per cent were in Distrito Nacional and the Santo Domingo province. The agricultural sector also faced significant losses, with extensive damage to crops, greenhouses, and livestock, affecting over 7,000 producers in various provinces. President Luis Abinader estimated the damages to exceed US$460 million (excluding the Ministry of Public Works and Communications' budget).\n\nIn the aftermath of the rains, ongoing health crises have continued to escalate. There has been an alarming surge of dengue, with 17,360 suspected cases, including 128 severe cases and 19 deaths this year. Additionally, a confirmed cholera outbreak in Barahona, heavily impacted by the floods, reported 29 cases, contributing to the overall national count of 1,109 suspected cases, 115 confirmed cases, and one death. The widespread impact of the event highlights the vulnerabilities of the country and the need to strengthen capacities to prevent, prepare and respond effectively. ([OCHA, 11 Dec 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/4022013/))\n\nOn 21 December 2023, the Emergency Operation Center of Dominican Republic (COE per its acronym in Spanish) published information about the heavy rains in the country. A total of 4 provinces are in yellow alert due to the flooding (3 decrease since the 20 December report). The heavy rains have affected 36 water distribution services and 400,133 people are without potable water (93,847 increase). ([PAHO, 22 Dec 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/4025854/))",

High water levels in the Akosombo reservoir led the Volta River Authority to start a controlled spillage process of the Akosombo and Kpong hydroelectric dams on 15 September 2023, which is still ongoing. The flooding has created a humanitarian challenge downstream in several communities in parts of the Volta, Eastern and Greater Accra regions. ([OCHA, 18 Oct 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/4007197))\n\nThe Volta Region in Ghana has experienced heavy rains and high inflows of water to the Akosombo and Kpong dam reservoir, leading to severe flooding that has displaced 30,000 people in 8 districts. Infrastructure, crops, and shelters have been damaged, and access to essential services has been disrupted. ([IOM, 27 November 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/4017898))\n\n[...] Initial inter-agency assessment led by NADMO on the consecutive floods in Volta region revealed on 26 October, 35,857 people in total are already affected in the region.

Additionally, in Nyala Town, Nyala Janoub locality, a total of 240 houses were totally or partially destroyed. In Beliel locality, heavy rains also resulted in the complete damage of 1,000 houses in Kalma IDP Camp and 330 houses in As Serief IDP Camp, whereas 670 houses in both camps were partially damaged. Reportedly, all affected households have been displaced and are currently sheltering with their relatives and neighbours in their respective locations of origin. Additionally, field teams reported seven deaths and no injuries. The area remains inaccessible to humanitarian actors. DTM is monitoring the situation closely and will be activating its Emergency Event Tracking (EET) tool, when possible, to track displacement and provide additional information on shelter, sex and age disaggregation, protection indicators, and urgent humanitarian needs. ([IOM, 5 Oct 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/4005738))\n\nOn 28 October, heavy rains and flooding occurred in several locations across Port Sudan City, Port Sudan locality, Red Sea State, reports IOM DTM. About 190 homes (affecting about 1,000 people) were damaged in 14 neighbourhoods. On 30 October, heavy rains and flooding occurred in Iram village of Sawakin locality. As a result, 10 people were reportedly killed, eight commercial buildings were damaged, a bridge collapsed, and many livestock were lost.\n\nSince the onset of the rainy season in July, about 89,000 people in 22 localities across nine states have been affected by heavy rains and flooding, according to the 2023 Sudan Floods Dashboard.

Several houses are reportedly inundated, including makeshift shelters hosting over 86,700 internally displaced people in 136 displacement sites in Baidoa City. Critical needs include shelter, food, clean safe water, hygiene and sanitation facilities, and medical assistance. The rains mark the beginning of the Deyr (October to December) rainy season in Somalia, expected to have above-normal rains and increased flooding due to the influence of the El Ni\u00f1o conditions in Somalia. ([OCHA, 7 Oct 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/4003743))\n\nThe Federal Government of Somalia has declared an emergency in areas where torrential deyr (October to December) rains have triggered floods, according to the Somalia Disaster Management Agency (SoDMA). The heavy rains fueled by an El Nino, have intensified particularly in Puntland, Galmudug, South West, Hirshabelle states and in areas along the Juba river in Jubaland State. Partners estimate that as of 6 November, over 706,100 people have been temporarily affected, with over 113,690 people temporarily displaced from their homes across the country. South West and Jubaland states are the worst affected, with an estimated 268,243 and 268,365 people affected, respectively. In Hirshabelle, at least 145,800 people are reportedly affected, with 11,700 displaced following heavy rains on 5 November. Up to 400 families (2,400 people) are believed to be trapped by floods in Luuq and efforts are ongoing to urgently evacuate them. In Baardheere, local authorities are appealing for urgent support for more than 14,000 families that have been cut off from the main town and are unable to replenish their domestic supplies. ([OCHA, 6 Nov 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/4012444))\n\nHeavy rains and flooding have extended to more areas of Somalia, with 33 of Somalia\u2019s 74 districts now deluged compared to 21 two weeks ago. The floods have also swept away 14 more people, pushing the death toll to 55 people from 41 last as of 17 November, including 14 children. Most newly affected districts are in South West State, Hirshabelle and Jubaland states, and Banadir region. The expanding emergency has affected at least 1.7 million people across Somalia, of whom 695,000 are displaced from their homes; an increase of 41,000 from last week. Vast swathes of farmland have been engulfed, properties destroyed and infrastructure damaged. In Luuq, the main bridge is flooded and at risk of being swept away. Buurdhubo bridge in Baardhere has been destroyed.

([IFRC, 22 Oct 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/4008082/))\n\nThe impact of these floods on agriculture has been severe, especially in the Southeast. According to partners, around 100,000 acres of paddy were damaged in Bago, with townships including Bago, Daik-U, Htantatbin, Gyobingauk, and Zigon being the hardest hit. Both ready-to-be-harvested and already-harvested paddy crops were damaged. [...] In response to flooding in the Southeast, local and international humanitarian organizations initiated immediate relief efforts to address the emerging needs in the affected areas. In Bago, 45 temporary relief sites were established to aid flood-affected communities in 9 villages in Bago township. These sites accommodated 5,920 households affected by the flood. [...] The humanitarian community continues to face access constraints across Myanmar, mainly due to ongoing military operations; administrative restrictions, including refusal of Travel Authorizations (TAs) and issues around NGO registration; and physical constraints caused by the Monsoon.

Since 4 September, an extratropical cyclone, bringing heavy rainfall, strong winds and hailstorms, has been severely affecting the states of Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul. According to the latest assessment from the Civil Defence in Rio Grande do Sul, the severe weather has affected at least 340,928 people across 93 municipalities, leaving 46 people dead, 46 people missing and 924 injured. Some 3,130 people have been rescued, while 20,498 residents have been displaced and a further 4,794 have been left homeless. In certain areas, river levels have surged to 17 metres above average, obstructing access from the capital city of Porto Alegre and the state's northern regions. This has complicated both the delivery of aid and the assessment of damages. In the state of Rio Grande do Sul, millions have been exposed to the impact of the cyclone and thousands directly impacted with damages to their homes. Entire communities are isolated and people have been waiting to be rescued. Both states are currently responding with their own resources and capacities.

In addition, IOM DTM reports over 900 relocated families from the affected area in eastern Libya and Derna toward western Libya, including in the Capital Tripoli. The reported figures are likely to increase as emergency interventions are ongoing. Over the next 48 hours, drier conditions are still forecast over the whole country. The EU Civil Protection Mechanism was activated on 12 September, so far various Member States delivered Search and Rescue Teams, Emergency Medical Teams, shelter and medical items, water tanks, generators and other items. The Copernicus Emergency Management Service (EMSR696) was activated and eight maps have been produced. ([ECHO, 22 Sep 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/3999426))\n\nThe situation of the northeast of Libya continues to be fragile following the disastrous flooding of 10 September with a death toll exceeding 4200 people, according to the World Health Organization and over 40,000 still displaced, as per the International Organization for Migration. Needs remain for food, water, shelter, healthcare, and logistical support for the flood survivors, homeless and displaced people.([WFP, 29 Sep 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/4001673/))\n\nOn Sunday 10 September, Storm Daniel struck the eastern coast of Libya. The cities of Benghazi, Al Marj, Al Bayda, Batah, Sousa, and Derna experienced extreme winds and massive flooding including from the collapse of two dams. Derna, the city most affected by the disaster saw significant destruction and loss of lives; 40,000 people have been internally displaced. An estimated 250,000 people need humanitarian assistance, including health, WASH, food, NFIs, and education. As of 30 September, international assistance provided by the UN and its partners had reached over 125,000 affected people. ([OCHA, 29 Sep 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/4001719))\n\nBeginning on 9 September 2023 Storm Daniel hit Libya, leading to substantial rainfall and sudden floods in the northeastern regions and coastal cities, with Derna being the most affected. The subsequent collapse of the Mansour and Derna dams severely compounded the damage suffered across Derna municipality. As of 19 October, 4,345 fatalities were confirmed and approximately 8,500 people are still missing. As of October 2023, DTM Libya estimates 44,862 IDPs were displaced as a result of the flooding.

    "description": "On 28 August, the Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs and Poverty Alleviation warned that about 13 Nigerian states would be at risk of intense flooding. It would happen between August and October, following the opening of the Lagdo Dam in Cameroon. The Nigerian Government identified the states most prone to flooding including Kogi, Benue, Adamawa, Bauchi, Borno, Gombe, Taraba, and Yobe. Floods in 2022 left over 600 people dead and affected more than 4.4 million people, according to the National Emergency Management Agency. The Government has set up a situation room and initiated a flood emergency preparedness and response plan, with temporary shelter and other relief items for affected people. Humanitarian actors in Borno, Adamawa, and Yobe States are complementing the government\u2019s effort through engagement and sensitization of flood-prone communities. ([OCHA, 31 Aug 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/3993366))\n\nThe recent release of water from Cameroon\u2019s Lagdo Dam has led to massive destruction, due to which there is damage to properties, foodstuffs, non-food items (NFI), shelter, and even displacement of the population in Adamawa State. On 5th October 2023, there was a rise in the water level in the Lagdo Dam due to heavy rainfall, which exaggerates the experience of flooding in the Adamawa state. Out of 21 LGAs in Adamawa State, 14 LGAs have been affected by the floods and windstorms. 33 deaths were recorded, with 504 households comprising 51,043 individuals affected across 214 communities. 81 IDP camps were established across Yola South, Yola North, Lamude, Madagali and Demsa LGAs respectively.

Major roads in Conakry and Siguiri were rendered impassable due to the flood waters, heavily constraining vehicles, and pedestrians having to find alternative routes. Different prefectures across the country continue to experience more heavy rains which may cause flooding in additional communities and increase the number of affected people.

    "description": "On 3-4 August, severe weather with heavy rain affected western, northern, eastern and central parts of the country, causing severe flooding and landslides. Some areas were inaccessible and necessary evacuations of residents took place. Slovenian Environment Agency (ARSO) has issued a red weather alert and the national emergency response plan for floods has been activated. The national authorities confirmed one person died. On 5 August, severe weather conditions continued to affect the country. Heaviest precipitation was reported mainly in the foothills of the Julian Alps and along the line of the Zidan\u0161ko\u2013Idrija region, through Gorenjska towards Koro\u0161ka and the Upper Savinjska region. The Savinja Valley, Gorenjska and Koro\u0161ka regions were severely affected, as a bridge on the main transport road was swept away and many state roads remain closed due to the flooding. During the day and overnight the precipitation moved to the south-east of Slovenia towards Ko\u010devje, Kolpa and Bela Krajina region, where highest risk levels were declared. On 6 August severe weather conditions persisted in Slovenia with rivers still overflowing across the country. The Sava River flooded heavily. Drava River was stabilised in the upper reaches and was moderated in the lower reaches. Mura river in Gornja Radgona was stabilised. It was reported that embankment on Mura river near settlement Krapje Verzej was breached. The Krka river overflowed in some areas. Problematic areas concerned the Sava and Krka rivers confluence around Kr\u0161ka Vas. The water level of Drava river slowly receded. Its flow, including from the Austrian side, was under control. A similar pattern was also observed for Mura river. On 7 August, the situation in Slovenia has slightly improved, however the situation remained critical since some rivers were still overflowing across the country. The heavy rainfall caused widespread damage leading to the collapse of at least seven main and regional bridges and mainly impacted roads and the energy infrastructure. Many more local bridges were damaged. On 8 August access to remote areas and areas affected by landslides still remained difficult. Approximately two-thirds of Slovenia's territory is currently grappling with the aftermath of flash floods, torrential rain, and hailstorm, with 181 municipalities affected out of the total of 212. In total, 8,000 people have been evacuated to their relatives or other accommodation facilities, and six people have lost their lives as a consequence of the disaster. Heavily affected regions include Upper Carniola, Central Slovenia, Koro\u0161ka region, as well as Savinjska region. [...] In the most affected areas, communication is disrupted and there is severe damage to infrastructure. Over 170 landslides are active, posing a continued threat to homes, infrastructure, and electricity. [...] On 11 August, the Ministry of Defense reported that by their first estimates more than 400 buildings (some including multiple housing units) were completely destroyed or declared uninhabitable. The loss of assets, homes and businesses, livestock, crops and infrastructure will affect job security and livelihoods in the mid-to long term. Because of the continuous threat of landslides, it is expected that more households will become in need of long-term shelter and basic needs support during the upcoming months.

    "description": "Heavy rainfall has been affecting central and eastern Afghanistan, in particular the Maidan Wardak Province, the Khost Province and the Kabul area, since 22 July, causing flash floods that have resulted in casualties and damage. As of 24 July, 31 fatalities, 41 persons still missing and 74 injured people are reported across Jalrez, Saydabad, Chaki Wardak and Maidan Shahr Districts, Maidan Wardak Province. Around 600 houses were reported damaged or destroyed across the same Province. In addition, media also reports four fatalities in the Kabul Capital City area and one more in the Khost Province, also in these cases due to flash floods. ([ECHO, 24 Jul 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/3982693))\n\nAs of 30 July 2023, according to reports from various sources including the Afghan Red Crescent Society (ARCS) and the Afghan National Disaster Management Authority (ANDMA), flash floods have led to the loss of 61 lives, left 24 people injured and six people missing. The province of Maidan Wardak is the most impacted and accounts for 37 of the 61 human lives lost. Based on the preliminary findings of the initial rapid assessment carried out by the\nARCS, approximately 126,000 people have been affected by the disaster in 18 provinces. The flash floods have also partially or completely damaged 1,360 residential houses and washed away over 13,023 hectares of agricultural land and killed at least 1,128 livestock. [...] Some of the provinces such as Badakhshan, Maidain Wardak and Nangahar have experienced such floods for the first time while others have experienced more severe floods this year than the ones in the past. The country is particularly vulnerable to variations in access to arable land and water due to drought that have been affecting the country for the last three consecutive years. New areas are experiencing floods due to dryness of land caused by drought for three consecutive years. ([IFRC, 7 Aug 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/3986939))\n\nBetween 1 and 30 July, heavy rains intensified and flash flooding affected some 6,193 people across eight provinces of Afghanistan \u2013 1,071 people in Kabul; 1,345 people in Kunar; 130 people in Laghman, 1,617 people in Maidan Wardak; 755 people in Nangarhar, 574 people in Nuristan; 581 people in Parwan; and 120 people in Zabul. Some 40 people were reportedly killed and 30 others were injured, while some 551 houses were damaged, and 121 others were destroyed. OCHA and humanitarian partners are conducting assessments alongside providing lifesaving assistance to the affected families. The number of people affected is anticipated to increase based on forecasts of more heavy rains and flooding in August, according to the Afghanistan meteorological department. ([OCHA, 9 Aug 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/3987349))\n\nOf all the natural disasters that have occurred in Afghanistan this year, flash flooding and heavy rains caused the most havoc as of the end of August, followed by earthquakes and heavy snowfall during the 2022/2023 winter. In total, around 21,500 people (2,952 families) affected by flooding, with 51 people killed, a further 62 injured, and 553 houses destroyed, and significant damage caused to 1,950 homes in 23 provinces across the country. Floods and heavy rains have also reportedly destroyed more than 3,000 acres of agricultural land, 50 irrigation canals, and 20 Kms of road, forests and farm infrastructure. The damage was most extensive in the north-eastern, central, and southern regions where 8,640, 5,830, and 1,193 people respectively were affected. Communities living in the southeastern (917 people), western (490 people) and northeastern (360 people) areas were also impacted by the heavy rains.

This calamity had widespread effects, impacting both urban and rural areas in Gurjaani and Lentekhi Municiplaities \u2013 Kakheti and Samegrelo-Zemo Svaneti regions, respectively. The heavy rainfall led to the flooding of the central streets in Gurjaani municipality, including the surrounding areas of the central agricultural market, resulting in severe difficulties in transportation and mobility. Additionally, sudden mudflows and landslides caused the destruction of roads, blockages from fallen trees, and damage to vital infrastructure like bridges and power transmission towers. Specifically, the flooding affected several areas in Gurjaani municipality, including Gurjaani, Chumlaki, Tchandari, Vejini, Dzirkoki, Kolagi, Bakurtsikhe, and Kodalo. In Lentekhi, which is one of the highest mountainous populated areas in Georgia, the storms affected Chikhareshi, Jakhunderi, Nakisheri, Skhedi, Upper Shkedi, Akhalsheni, Panaga, and Lekosadeni villages. State infrastructure such as bridges, in-land roads, and power transmission towers were also damaged. [...] Although Georgia is prone to flooding and hailstorms, it is worth noting that these kinds of floods are not common in either of these municipalities, as none of them are located in high-risk flash flood zones.

These floods are the result of heavy rainfall, the overflowing of rivers and the breaching of dikes. As of 21 September 2022, over 37,000 people were affected by floods with two people killed and more than 95 people injured. More than 9,000 houses were destroyed, about a dozen health facilities and 88 schools were flooded with over 26,615 children deprived of education. More than 2,400 hectares of fields were destroyed, 3,019 livestock were lost, 190 water points and 535 latrines were submerged. Communities were forced to move to safer areas, often in very precarious conditions with difficult access to drinking water, lack of latrines, food, shelters, etc. Access to hard-to-reach areas has been severely hampered by the floods, impacting the timely delivery of nutrition, food, health and protection services. Continued rainfall and rising water levels could cause the remaining dikes along the Logone river and Lake Maga to break, resulting in flooding in several localities. Despite the spontaneous response of local authorities and of the Cameroonian Red Cross, needs remain high, and the funds limited. Under the coordination of OCHA, humanitarian actors in the region are further helping to assess the situation and organizing the support to the ongoing response made by local authorities. ([OCHA, 11 Oct 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3894957))\n\nMore than 150,000 people have been affected by flooding resulting from heavy rainfall and river overflow in the Far North region since August. Floods have destroyed over 18,000 homes and at least 27,400 hectares of fields. Water points and latrines were damaged and more than 5,800 cattle lost. School activities were disrupted as more than 126 schools were flooded, affecting more than 38,000 students. Mayo-Danay, Logone et Chari, and Mayo-Tsanaga are the most affected departments. Access to the affected areas is reduced due to flooded roads while the presence of hippos in the waterways discourages travel by boat. Thousands of people have been displaced to areas not affected by the floods with limited access to drinking water, latrines, and food. The majority of displaced people are with host families or in makeshift shelters in the open air. Most urgent needs include shelter, WASH, food, NFIs and healthcare.

Due to lack of real-time information, this estimate does not represent all the damage (information provisionally made available by OCHA on 5 August 2022 in the snapshot). During the week of 01 to 7 August 2022, the successive heavy rainfall in N'Djamena, combined with the low-lying position of the Gozator hospital and the lack of drainage in its vicinity caused the main basin behind it to overflow and led to an unprecedented flooding of the hospital.

The flooding is a result of heavy rainfall across the country, overflowing of rivers and/or the breaching of dikes.

([IFRC, 1 Sep 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3882097))\n\nOn 2 September, feedback was received from the SATHORIO that the Niamey hydrometeorological station temporarily malfunctioned during the period from 28 August to 3 September 2022, As a result, the water threshold in the bulletin dated 29 August 2022 was incorrect, which was the bulletin used to activate the EAP. Moreover, the wrong interpretation of the meteorological data was also influenced by the heavy rainfall recorded during the same period downstream of the river. Therefore, the EAP activation was a false alarm. At this time, based on the information from National Coordination Unit (NCU), and in coordination with the National Director of Hydraulics (DHN), early actions were paused pending further clarification. \n\nOn 8 September, a field visit was organized including representatives from the CRN, the Ministry of Humanitarian Actions and Early Warning Systems, Direction of Civil Protection, National Director of Hydraulics, the local Administrative Authority, Niger Basin Authority and IFRC. The field visit identified that in addition to the false alarm mentioned above, the protective embankment is being raised (work started in August 2022) to more than 650 cm (photo 2 and 3), along the river in the Niamey River by the Disaster Risk Management and Urban Development Project (DRMP-UD). Following the field visit, on 12 September, it was unanimously decided that the probability of flooding was very low (less than 20%), therefore, the EAP actions should stop. ([IFRC, 7 Oct 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3894093))\n\nIn Niger, 195 people died as a result of prolonged rainfall and flooding, which have so far affected about 327,000 people, since June. The southern regions of Zinder and Maradi, which border Nigeria, were the hardest hit. ([OCHA, 10 Nov 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3905431))",

The currently available data indicate that around 7.9 million people may be temporarily displaced. About 20.6 million people and 650,000 flood-affected refugees and host communities require humanitarian assistance. The Government of Pakistan is leading the response with the support of UN agencies and humanitarian partners to ensure a coordinated response in food, medicines, health, water, sanitation, and essential supplies and non-food items. ([OCHA, 10 Oct 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3895139/))\n\nIn Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa areas, people are returning to their places of origin or at least close to it to assess their livelihoods' condition. During the last weeks' receding waters were observed, particularly in affected areas of Sindh and Balochistan. In Sindh, water is receding in the districts of Kashmore, Kandhkot, Larkana, Ghotki, Sukkur, Tando Allahyar, Shaheed Benazirabad, Tando Muhammad Khan, Umerkot and Sanghar. [...] In the flood-affected areas of Sindh and Balochistan, outbreaks of water-borne and vector-borne diseases continue to increase, particularly due to the destruction of health facilities and standing water. The Government-led multi-sector rapid needs assessments (RNA) conducted in the worst-affected districts of Sindh indicated that thirty-seven per cent of key informants reported that the nearest health facility is not functional, and the ones who reported a health facility nearby stated the limited capacity of the facility. As of 5 October, according to the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), close to 2,000 health facilities have been either damaged or destroyed. [...] The health situation is also exacerbated by the lack of adequate sanitation facilities. Large parts of Sindh remain flooded, with access continuing to be a challenge in inundated areas. An estimated 5.5 million people no longer have access to safe drinking water due to damages to water infrastructure and sanitation facilities. [...] The current floods have aggravated food insecurity and malnutrition in flood-affected areas. An estimated 14.6 million people require emergency food assistance from December through March 2023, representing an increase of more than 100 per cent of the pre-flood estimate. This includes 4 million people in Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC). ([OCHA, 14 Oct 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3896583/))\n\nThe monsoon rains continue to affect Pakistan by causing floods, landslides, flash floods, and severe weather-related incidents, which have resulted in a humanitarian emergency. Since mid-June, at least 1,730 people have died, of which 792 people died in Sindh Province (south-eastern Pakistan), 336 in Balochistan (south-western Pakistan), and 308 in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (north-western Pakistan), according to the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA). Nearly 12,865 individuals have been injured across all Provinces of Pakistan and more than 33 Million people have been affected, of which 14.5 Million in Sindh, and 9.2 million in Balochistan. Widespread damage has been reported to over 2.2 million houses, more than 1.1 million livestock has been lost and more than 13,000 km of roads and 440 bridges have been affected. ([ECHO, 25 Oct 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3899781/))\n\nMalaria cases are increasing due to the stagnant water, while the incidence of diarrhea is at least five times higher than usual, especially in Sindh and Balochistan, where more than 1 in 9 children under five admitted to health facilities suffered from severe acute malnutrition. More than 3.5 million children's education was interrupted due to the impact of floods. Some sectors noted inadequate funding and delays in supplies as a major gap in responding to the needs of hard-to-reach areas. Roughly only 15-20 per cent of the affected population has received relief assistance from humanitarians. ([OCHA, 29 Oct 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3901401/))\n\nPublic health concerns are high in flood-affected areas of Pakistan, particularly with access to primary healthcare limited by monsoon-induced damage to health facilities. As of 25 October, 59 health facilities are destroyed and 461 are partially damaged in Sindh, where nearly 350,000 people were suspected of having malaria, more than 700,000 people had diarrhea, and over 770,000 people reported a skin-related disease between July and early October. Stagnant water has contributed to malaria outbreaks in 32 districts in Sindh and Balochistan. The practice of open defecation has increased from one-fifth before the floods to over one-third of the affected population, with 6 million people no longer having home sanitation facilities. ([OCHA, 1 Nov 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3902021/))\n\nAs of 8 November, according to World Health Organization (WHO), around 8 million flood-affected people need health assistance. Vector-borne and water-borne diseases remain a major concern in flood-affected areas. Around 1,000 confirmed cholera cases and 64,767 dengue fever cases, with 147 deaths, have been reported. More than 5.1 million women are of reproductive age, including an estimated 410,846 pregnant women. Approximately 136,950 births are expected in the next three months. ([OCHA, 11 Nov 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3906187))\n\nAccording to National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), more than 33 million persons have been affected by the humanitarian emergency caused by the floods, about 1,739 people have died and almost 8 million people have been displaced. Widespread damage has been reported to critical infrastructure, houses and livestock. The findings from a recent ECHO field staff\u2019s visit to flood-affected areas in Sindh and Balochistan show that the situation remains dire with great extensions of land still covered by water. At least 1.85 million people remain still displaced, living in roadside spontaneous camps in poor conditions. A serious concern remains that many of the people returning are moved to places with no infrastructure, no shelter and residing on elevated areas with flood waters around. ([OCHA, 28 Nov 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3911040))\n\nFloodwaters continue to recede in many flood-affected areas across Pakistan. However, standing flood waters continue to be reported in Dadu, Kambar, Shahdad Kot, Khairpur, Mirpur Khas, Jamshoro, Sanghar, Umer Kot, Badin, Shaheed Benazir Abad and Naushahro Feroze districts in Sindh and Sohbatpur and Jaffarabad districts in Balochistan. United Nations Satellite Centre (UNOSAT) imagery indicates an estimated 8 million people still potentially exposed to floodwaters or living close to flooded areas. According to the Provincial Disaster Management Authority of Sindh, over 240,000 people remain displaced in the province as of 3 December, down from 6.5 million in early September. Nearly 90% of flood-displaced people are reportedly with host communities, while the remaining are in tent cities and relief camps. While receding flood waters have allowed millions of people to go home, there are reports of significant service gaps in areas of return, in addition to extensive impacts to homes, agriculture, and livelihoods. [...] A recent need and gaps analysis by partners in the food security sector indicates a persistent and increasing need for emergency food assistance moving into the first quarter of 2023. A failure to address this need would worsen the already frail food security situation and drive more people into crisis and emergency levels. The food security situation of an estimated additional 1.1 million people is deteriorating and are forecast to fall into IPC 4 (emergency food security phase)\nbetween January-March 2023. Evidence from available data indicates that relief response to date has fallen well short of the need, with over 5.1 million people now experiencing IPC 4 conditions in flood-affected areas. ([OCHA, 5 Dec 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3913492))\n\nDuring the monsoon season, rainfall was equivalent to nearly 2.9 times the national 30-year average, causing widespread flooding and landslides with severe repercussions for human lives, property, and infrastructure. An estimated 20.6 million people, including 9.6 million children, need humanitarian assistance. To date, 94 districts have been declared \u2018calamity hit\u2019 by the Government of Pakistan. Many of the hardest-hit districts are amongst the most vulnerable districts in Pakistan, where children already suffer from high malnutrition, poor access to water and sanitation, low school enrolment, and other deprivations. In mountainous and high altitude areas of Pakistan, many also affected by the floods, have received snowfall and temperatures have fallen below 0 Celsius, particularly in the northern and northwestern parts of Pakistan including Khyber Pakhtunkwa (KP), Gilgit Baltistan (GB), Pakistan Administered Kashmir (PAK) and northern Balochistan. ([UNICEF, 23 Dec 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3919294))\n\nIn some locations of Sindh province and in parts of Balochistan, water has yet to recede and may remain for several months, prolonging the dire humanitarian situation for people in these areas. Flood water remains stagnant in Dadu, Jacobabad, Kambar, Shahdad Kot, Khairpur, Mirpur Khas, Jamshoro, Sanghar, Umer Kot, Badin, Shaheed Benazir Abad and Naushahro Feroze districts in Sindh and Sohbatpur, Jhal Magsi and Jaffarabad districts in Balochistan. According to the Provincial Disaster Management Authority of Sindh, over 89,000 people remain displaced in the province as of 2 January 2023, down from 6.5 million in early September. The IDPs living in ten districts including Dadu, ShikarPur, Matiari, Mirpur Khas, Jaccobabad, Jamshoro, Tando Allahyar, Thatta, Khairpur and Karachi with the highest number of IDPs in Dadu (41,742) and the lowest in Karachi (356 IDPs). ([OCHA, 6 Jan 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/3922246))\n\nFood security, livelihood-related assistance and public health are the biggest concerns: based on the latest analysis by UNOSAT, an estimated 4.5 million people remain exposed to or living close to flooded areas. More than 2.5 million people do not have access to safe or potable water. An estimated 1.1 million people are at risk of sliding from acute food and livelihood crisis (IPC3) situations to humanitarian emergency (IPC4) food security situations due to insufficient support. Malaria outbreaks have been reported in at least 12 districts of Sindh and Balochistan. More than 7 million children and women need immediate access to nutrition services. An estimated 3.5 million children, especially girls, are at high risk of permanent school dropout. The Pakistan Floods Response Plan is only 36 per cent funded more than halfway through its 9-month duration. ([OCHA, 6 Feb 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/3931198))\n\nCamps housing internally displaced persons in Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), and Punjab provinces have closed, while 29,692 people remain\ndisplaced in Sindh province, with 5,132 people living in temporary tent cities or villages established by the District Disaster Management Authority. High food prices and a heavy reliance on imports continue to threaten Pakistan's food and nutrition security. Meanwhile, the 2022-2023 Rabi season, combined with the unstable availability of wheat flour, has resulted in significant price fluctuations and uncertainty affecting other essential goods\u2019 prices. According to WFP monitoring data, the floods led to a 53 percent increase in new malnutrition cases from July 2022 to January 2023 amongst children enrolled in the 50 pilot facilitation centres of the *Benazir Nashonuma Programme*, the national social protection scheme aimed at improved health and nutrition. Additional funding is urgently required to treat Moderate and Acute Malnutrition (MAM) to prevent the progression to Severe Acute Malnutrition. ([WFP, 28 Feb 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/3943897))\n\nSix months after the Government of Pakistan declared a national emergency, approximately 1.8 million people are still living near contaminated and stagnant floodwater pools. Nutrition, food security and public health are the major concerns as many of these people are in temporary shelters, lack basic food items (at risk of sliding into emergency level of hungers) and increased cases of malnutrition. Besides other humanitarian needs in Sindh province, PDMA Sind has declared an urgent need for dewatering activities in the districts of Nausharo Feroze, Khairpur, Sukkur, Jhatta, and Ghotki. To achieve this, five excavators, dewatering pumps, and fuel are required to complete the dewatering process and provide the people in these areas with appropriate livelihood standards. ([OCHA, 9 Mar 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/3942002))\n\nThere is a looming nutrition crisis: the number of children suffering from wasting in Pakistan\u2019s flood-affected areas had greatly increased compared to the pre-flood situation, which was already reaching emergency levels. A rapid survey by UNICEF in 15 flood-affected districts reveals that one-third of children aged 6-23 months suffer from moderate acute malnutrition, and 14% suffer from severe acute malnutrition, a life-threatening form of malnutrition. The rate of severe acute malnutrition in Pakistan is twice that of the South Asian region and four times higher than the global average. The United Nations in Pakistan dedicates US$5.5 million out of the US$6.5 million allocation received from the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) towards emergency nutrition and food security interventions in flood impacted areas of Sindh and Balochistan. According to the latest WFP Market Monitor Report, Pakistan's Headline inflation based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) is the highest it has been in the past 49 years, having increased by 31.55 per cent in February 2023 compared to February 2022. Since April 2023, heavy rainfall and flashfloods have tragically caused the death of 19 people, injured more than 10, and destroyed properties, bridges, highways, crops, and livestock. ([OCHA, 8 May 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/3961101))\n\nDespite the passage of nearly a year since the floods, Pakistan is currently facing an imminent nutrition crisis, which has been aggravated by pre-existing high rates of malnutrition in flood-affected regions. Of particular concern is the increasing malnutrition among young children, as undernutrition accounts for nearly half of all deaths in children under five. Shockingly, one in five children under five in Pakistan suffer from wasting, with severe and moderate acute malnutrition rates at 8 percent and 9.7 percent, respectively. The 84 districts affected by the 2022 monsoon flooding display distressing nutrition indicators. These districts have an average severe acute malnutrition rate of 12 percent, impacting over 3.5 million children. Among them, more than 1.45 million children require treatment with Ready to Use Therapeutic Food (RUTF) due to severe wasting. [...] As of June 5, 2023, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) indicates that approximately 10.5 million people (29 percent of those analyzed) from 43 districts in vulnerable provinces of Pakistan are facing acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 or above). Within this population, around 2.1 million individuals (6 percent) are in IPC Phase 4 (Emergency), while 8.4 million people (23 percent) are in IPC Phase 3 (Crisis). These areas, including Balochistan (18 districts), Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (9 districts), and Sindh (16 districts), were severely affected by the monsoon rains and flooding in late 2022, which greatly impacted food production, consumption, livelihoods, and employment opportunities. ([OCHA, 13 Jun 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/3970907))\n\nAccording to the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), the first spell of monsoon rains in Pakistan during the period of 25 June to 10 July has resulted in 86 deaths, 151 injuries, damage to 97 houses, and the loss of 46 livestock. In Punjab province, Lahore City witnessed an exceptional volume of rainfall, setting a record for the highest levels observed in the past three decades. With over 200 mm of rainfall, the city faced significant urban flooding. The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) has issued warnings of more rains, wind-thunderstorm, land sliding in hilly areas and high-level flooding in rivers such as Sutlej, Ravi, Chenab, and Jhelum. It is important to note that the monsoon rains are exacerbating the already dire conditions faced by the communities that have been affected by the 2022 floods in Pakistan.

According to the Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre (FFWC), around 94 percent of Sunamganj and over 84 percent of Sylhet are submerged. The crisis struck at a time when the people of the division were recovering from unexpected recent floods that hit in late May. An estimated 4.3 million people are impacted by this sudden flash flood and water congestion in seven northeastern districts of Sylhet, Sunamganj, Moulivazar, Habiganj, Netrakona, and Brahmanbaria. Many households are isolated due to floods, while some have taken shelter in open areas. The safety and security of women and girls in those households are at high risk. As many as 25,000 people have been taken to around 450 shelter centres in Sylhet; at the same time, 65,000 people were evacuated to 200 shelter centres in Sunamganj in a combined effort of the Army, Navy, Fire Service, and the local authorities.

However, there are still 19,221 people including 3,229 children and 166 people with disability (PwD) living in 275 shelters in Sylhet and Sunamganj. Hundreds of families are reportedly staying with their relatives and extended family members while some others remain in common buildings. There are people living in remote sub-districts that remain hard to reach due to flooding and poor road infrastructures. Basic services, notably health facilities, are slowly returning to normal. The massive challenges remains in the WASH sector, the Department of Public Health Engineering (DPHE) estimated that some 106,727 water points and 283,355 sanitation facilities have been immensely damaged, all needs restoration and reconstruction. Meanwhile, the risk of Acute Watery Diarrhoea outbreaks, skin and respiratory diseases continue to be high. As of 13th July, 12,503 cases of waterborne diseases and other ailments have been reported in Sylhet division.

([UNICEF, 23 Jul 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3869165/))\n\nAs of 3 August, all families have left the flood shelters in Sylhet and Sunamganj district. They returned home and started caring for the homesteads, which got various damages. Most of the affected families shared their immediate needs in basic household items such as cooking utensils and furniture. They also explained their struggles to access the WASH facilities and lost livelihoods. Thousands of families could not save their crops, seeds, and fodders from the sudden surge of the flood water that stayed for days. Many affected families are now in search of alternative earnings to manage their daily meals. Over the past two weeks, there has been an increase in calls to the Child Helpline 1098, with more than 85 per cent of the calls from flood-affected areas being related to violence against children and women (VACW). As of 29 July, 19,918 cases of waterborne diseases and other ailments have been reported, and 74 people died, including 33 children in Sylhet division. The risk of Acute Watery Diarrhoea outbreaks and skin and respiratory diseases continues to be high. In Sylhet and Sunamganj districts, 349 community clinics out of 505 have been affected by flash flood. Sunamganj, one of the most flood-affected areas, is also one of the districts lagging in education parameters. The high dropout rate in primary education and many out-of-school children pose the biggest challenge. More than 3,000 primary and secondary schools in Sylhet and Sunamganj districts have been affected and remained closed for about a month, resulting in colossal learning loss for over 1.5 million learners. Schools urgently require extensive cleaning and repair work.

    "description": "On 11-13 April, severe flooding and landslides caused by heavy rainfall affected southern and south-eastern South Africa, particularly the Provinces of KwaZulu-Natal and Eastern Cape. According to national authorities, 443 people died in KwaZulu-Natal and over 40,000 are missing. More than 40,000 people have been displaced, while nearly 4,000 houses were destroyed and more than 8,000 others were damaged, mostly across Durban City and its surrounding areas. A National State of Disaster has been declared in response to the floods and landslides, and rescue teams have been deployed to the affected areas to provide humanitarian assistance to those most affected. The International Disaster Charter 755 was activated for South Africa. On 19-20 April, moderate rainfall is forecast over north-eastern South Africa, while no heavy rainfall is expected over the already affected Provinces. ([ECHO, 19 Apr 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3838780))\n\nSevere flooding and landslides caused by heavy rainfall on 11-13 April caused the death of 448 people, displaced over 40,000 people and completely destroyed over 12,000 houses in the south-east part of South Africa. It also severely damaged infrastructures: roads, health centres, schools. On 18 April, the President of South Africa declared a national state of disaster due to floods severity. On 20 April, DG ECHO field mission reported massive unattended or inadequately addressed needs notably in the most remote and isolated severely affected areas. The most urgent needs are food, clean water and hygiene packs; health, care and psychological first aid (PFA); protection and education in emergencies. ([ECHO, 26 Apr 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3841031))\n\nThe KwaZulu-Natal Provincial Government is planning to set up 4 396 temporary accommodation sites as from the end of this week to accommodate families that are currently accommodated in community halls, churches and schools. Giving the latest update on the response to the floods in the province on Sunday, KwaZulu-Natal Premier, Sihle Zikalala, said the construction of temporary residential units has started at Ilembe District, Ugu and eThekwini. Zikalala said the provincial government is finalising the assessment of some sites in Durban in terms of their suitability for construction. \u201cWe are encouraged by the support we are getting from the national government. An integrated approach involving three spheres of government is assisting to ensure speed and efficiency in the interventions,\u201d Zikalala said. Zikalala said that although government has reprioritised R1 billion towards disaster relief interventions, the province needs more than R1.9 billion to complete the work. ([Gov't of South Africa, 26 Apr 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3840952))\n\nSince the original floods rains have continued and part of KwaZulu-Natal continue to be struck by devastating flooding with reports of more people being evacuated to safe areas and more roads and houses have been flooded. On 23 May, an orange level warning has been issued for disruptive rain, floodings and mudslides over the extreme north-eastern parts of KwaZulu-Natal. Six weeks later and thousands remain in evacuation shelters with an uncertain future. It's a long journey ahead for many people who have lost family member, their homes or livelihoods. As the true picture of the devastation caused by the floods emerges, many still need all help. On rebuilding homes for families, the government is working to identifying suitable land to house new settlements for the displaced. But in the meantime, thousands of people have been left homeless and are living in shelters across the province.

According to Tunisia\u2019s National Institute of Meteorology, the centre of the country and central-west regions including Siliana, Kairouan, Gafsa, Sidi Bouzid, Jendouba, Beja, El Kef, and Kasserine, recorded 60 mm and 80 mm of rain over four days, to locally reach an accumulative level 120 mm of rain. The country\u2019s Civil Protection announced the death of an elderly woman in the governorate of Siliana and a second person is missing in the governorate of Kairouan. TRC teams reported three destroyed houses in Kairouan and two in Siliana as an impact of the heavy rain.\n\nConsequently, floodwater surged through many different districts, damaging infrastructure, houses, properties, and livelihoods in the affected areas. Moreover, crops and fruit trees were damaged by the heavy rain, and electricity has been cut off in some districts. \n\nBased on the TRC rapid assessments conducted in coordination with the local authorities, more than 4,000 people have been affected by the floods. Some of them fled their homes seeking shelter in neighbouring high-ground houses and villages, while others opted to stay in their damaged houses and move to rooftops rather than risk crossing flooded areas to reach evacuation points. Water supply through pipelines is limited, and some of the water available in some areas is contaminated. ([IFRC, 1 Apr 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3834496))",

Unofficial estimates place the economic losses at around USD 200 million. Dozens of roads and highways remain closed. There have been unscheduled water cuts and disruptions to the electricity supply. Search and rescue have been hampered by a lack of assets (boats and other vessels) to navigate through the waterways formed around high-density residential areas near low-lying flood basins, exacerbated by coordination issues between authorities. The situation is worsened in low-cost housing areas, where residents of single-storey linked houses do not have the option of moving themselves and their assets to the upper floors. There have been medical evacuations as the elderly and people with chronic diseases suffered from lack of food, running water, disrupted electricity supply and shortage of medication.

The heavy rains overnight caused a flash flood in Erbil, the region\u2019s capital, and Kirkuk Governorate, located in Northern Iraq. The incident caused widespread damage to houses, infrastructure, and vehicles. Muddy water swept into people\u2019s homes in Erbil's Daratu, Qushtapa, Shamamk, Zhyan, Roshinbiri, and Bahrka neighbourhoods in the early hours of the morning, forcing individuals out of their houses. According to the Kurdish region government on 19 December, 14 people were reported dead by the floods and more than 7,000 people are affected, while IRCS carried further rapid assessments to confirm with the families. More are feared missing while search and rescue operations are ongoing. [...] The disastrous heavy rains came at a time when Iraq was suffering with severe droughts, where seven million Iraqis have been already affected and most of the agricultural land is completely affected by the droughts spell and left people with more vulnerabilities. [...] Iraq is particularly vulnerable to the effects of extreme weather patterns, most likely caused by climate change due to its underdeveloped infrastructure.

    "description": "Yan, Kedah was faced with a flash flood from the foothill of Mount Jerai (Gunung Jerai). The flash flood happened on Wednesday, 18 August 2021 at 5.30 pm (Local Malaysian Time). The heavy downpour caused water surges and landslides on Gunung Jerai that later hit Yan, Kuala Muda, and Bandar Baharu district in Kedah with muddy flash floods. The surrounding location of Gunung Jerai Resort was severely damaged. Difficulty in road access from the affected flash flood sites hampered the search and rescue of the casualties believed to have drowned and been swept away by the strong current. The flash floods have affected approximately 879 families (4,395 people) in the affected area of Yan district and 86 families (430 people) in Kubang Pasu district. The data collected is based on the district office in Yan and Kuala Muda as of 22 August 2021.\n\nThe Government opened two evacuation centres and hosted 43 people for short-term assistance. Currently, the evacuation centres had been closed. Out of 4,825 people affected by the flash flood, only 43 people went to the evacuation centres. People from the affected flash flood villages were hesitant to evacuate to the centres due to the fear of COVID-19 transmission. COVID-19 cases in the Yan district are considered high at the state level. For Yan district, 395 positive COVID-19 cases have been reported, and in Kuala Muda district, figures have reached 6,285 cases. Carrying sediment and large tree trunks, the flash floods impacted nearby houses in the Kampung Pematang Keramat. Most of the houses in this village are 2 km from the primary impact area of the foothill of Gunung Jerai. The affected houses are covered in mud, some with minor damage.\n\nVillages affected by the flash flood were covered with mud and sand on the houses since 18 August 2021. Of the three affected locations, the Yan district is the most affected location. Heavy rains poured a massive volume of water down a stream from Gunung Jerai, sweeping tree trunks and rocks through two km of the surrounding area. The ensuing floods destroyed local village livestock and vegetable farms. Local authorities have confirmed six deaths.\n\nIn Kuala Muda district, most areas were covered with muddy water, tree trunks, and large rocks from the side of the river. Despite mud covering houses, flood victims did not report heavy damage. People did, however, report damage to several home appliances and furniture. The walls of a few residences are damaged, smashed by rocks from the nearby river. Most of the houses are built with concrete structures and wood materials.\n\nA river overflowed in Banda Baharu district, as heavy downpour caused pressure on a dam, flooded its water capacity and impacted poor drainage systems. Houses in this district were covered with muddy water with 25 people affected, and local authorities are providing assistance to this district.\n\nIn the two districts of Yan and Kuala Muda, flash floods destroyed farmland and plantations. Livestock loss such as chickens, goats, and cows was also reported, which are critical livelihood or safety net assets for the affected. Some farmers reportedly lost harvests due to the flood, which is significant as the rice harvest is due later this month. Kedah state is currently experiencing the third wave of COVID-19, with cases escalating in the last two weeks, reaching 1,538 new cases per day and 24,306 active cases. Kedah state is the seventh highest state with COVID-19 cases in Malaysia, reporting 89,027 cases as of 26 August 2021. In Malaysia, a Movement Control Order (MCO) is still ongoing, and the country has a COVID-19 recovery plan with different phases.

Another nine townships were affected by floods in Mon State, while in Tanintharyi Region, at least three townships have been affected.\n\nLocal humanitarian actors, volunteers and communities responded to the needs of affected families, including with organizing temporary shelter for those who had to be evacuated to safer areas. The floods have also damaged crops, and according to initial assessments, at least 2,000 acres of paddy fields in Kyainseikgyi Township in Kayin State have been impacted, with farmers facing difficulties with seeds and expenses to cover replanting of the paddy. An additional 40,000 cultivated land has been affected across different states and regions, according to partners. ([OCHA, 27 Aug 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3768883))\n\nThe monsoon weather system is strong and active, and on 24 August, Department of Meteorology and Hydrology (DMH) forecast predicted water levels may exceed the danger level of major rivers and river dams such as Ayeyarwady River and Sittoung River that are currently in critical situation and could have the ability to impact the most at-risk areas. As of 25 August, the Thanlwin River has exceeded the danger zone (see in Annex forecast). There are concerns that the weather system, fluvial floods, and flash floods could cause damage in communities across several regions, particularly in Shan (East), Kayin, Mon, Rakhine, Tanintharyi, Magway, Mandalay, Kachin, Sagaing and Chin regions. Some of these areas have experienced previous devastation by the flood in 2015 and 2017. It is estimated more than 1.6 million vulnerable people are likely to be impacted by sessional monsoon related disasters. DMH forecasts that the monsoon season will continue until October with medium to heavy rainfall and it is likely that Myanmar will experience new floods, in addition to probable increased severity impacts.

The flooding is creating a perfect breeding ground for mosquitos, while most people don\u2019t even have mosquito nets, leaving them dangerously exposed to diseases. The cumulative impact of the loss of harvests, cattle deaths and floods have led to the collapse of traditional livelihoods. The situation has limited food stocks in the few available functional markets and the supply of these stocks has been cut off. This has forced the food prices to go up. People have waited for flood water to recede and have watched the flood increase day by day since June 2021. ([IFRC, 25 Jan 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3811293))\n\nMost communities affected depend on farming for survival and the flooding has made it hard to practice subsistence farming worsening food insecurity and the start of long rains in April 2022 worsening the dire situation. The impacts are especially harsh in Jonglei, Unity, and Upper Nile state, where thousands of people have been displaced or marooned in dike-ringed compounds, holding back floodwaters with mud, sticks, and plastic sheeting. In a prediction to Uganda, ICPAK has predicted heavy rainfall (greater than 100mm) over South Sudan for the period 24 \u2013 31st May 2022 as the UN projects the impacts from floods will be even dire in South Sudan by the time the rainy season ends.  ([IFRC, 2 Jun 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3853155))\n\nFlooding and heavy rains continue to impact people across the country, including Jonglei, Lakes, Northern Bahr el Ghazal, Western Bahr el Ghazal, Unity, Upper Nile, Warrap, and Western Equatoria states. Eastern Equatoria and Western Equatoria states that have not been affected by 2021 floods are now reported flooded. In Unity, floodwater levels have risen above the level measured in 2021 by 10 centimeters. Reports indicate that heavy rains and floods have destroyed crops, people\u2019s homes, schools, health care centres, boreholes and killed people. An estimated 386,000 people have been affected based on assessments that were conducted in 18 of the 27 counties reportedly impacted by floods. ([OCHA, 19 Sep 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3889251))\n\nHeavy rainfall has been affecting Western Equatoria State (south-western South Sudan) over the past days, causing floods and river overflow (in particular the Mori River) that have resulted in evacuations and damage. The United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS) reports, as of 28 September, nearly 29,800 displaced people, a number of whom have been relocated to higher and safer grounds, mainly across Mundri West County (eastern Western Equatoria State). Humanitarian efforts are underway to aid displaced communities. ([ECHO, 19 Sep 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3891067))\n\nSince late August, heavy rains and flooding impact people across the country and in the southern part of the Abyei Administrative Area, with over 900,000 people reportedly affected. Most affected states are Northern Bahr el Ghazal, Warrap, Unity and Western Equatoria but also Jonglei and Upper Nile currently affected by conflicts and a difficult access. The floods will further drive food insecurity as 16.5kha cropland is potentially affected. Homes, schools and health facilities have been destroyed. Roads and bridges washed away hampering humanitarians to reach affected people. Boreholes and latrines submerged thereby contaminating water sources and risking outbreaks of waterborne diseases. Priority needs include food assistance, shelter, health, nutrition and WASH supplies. Contingency stocks in WASH and Shelter-Non Food Items pipelines have been considerably depleted. Flood response preparedness plans were implemented and response is ongoing, including through the EU-funded Emergency/Rapid Response Mechanisms. However, insecurity, violence against aid workers and access constraints continue to hamper the overall floods response. ([ECHO, 13 Oct 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3895776))\n\nSince July 2022, an estimated 1 million people were affected by severe flooding in 36 counties across South Sudan and in the southern part of the Abyei Administrative Area.  \nFlood waters continue to block humanitarian access in Unity State, especially in the southern part of the state including Bentiu and into Jonglei State. An estimated 7 380 people are displaced by flooding in areas of Rubkona county. ([WHO, 27 Apr 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/3956535))",

Reports indicate that at least 25 people have been killed due to the heavy rains including nine children who died after their house flooded in Banadir on 7 May, and four people killed by lightening in Puntland on 5 May. In Middle Shabelle region, riverine flooding has affected an estimated 25,000 people in 15 villages in Jowhar, displacing people in eight villages and inundating farms. FAO/SWALIM has warned of the imminent danger of potentially unprecedented flooding expected along the Shabelle river in the coming days and the concern for safety and wellbeing of the people in Belet Weyne and along the river. Reports from Jubaland indicate that the Juba river broke its bank in Doolow, reaching 4.70 metres, which is 0.20 metres above the moderate flooding level, flooding three villages. [(OCHA, 9 May 2021)](https://reliefweb.int/node/3736896)    \n\nThe recent torrential rains across Somalia affected an estimated 166,000 people. While the rains have reduced in some areas, humanitarian partners are alarmed that Somalia has been hit by a double climate disaster, with drought declared on 25 April and heavy rains last week causing riverine and flash flooding. The seven-day forecast ending 20 May indicates a dry spell is likely across Somalia and in the Ethiopian highlands, which may lead to a reduction of the risk of flooding along the Shabelle and Juba rivers. Humanitarian partners are particularly concerned about areas where the risk of flooding remans, particularly in Belet Weyne in Hiiran region and Doolow in Jubaland where there remains a high-risk level of flooding as the water from Ethiopia highlands stream in. The flood wave from Belet Weyne will be transmitted to the middle and lower reaches towards the end of the week and therefore there is a moderate risk of flooding in these areas during this week. The situation could be further exacerbated by weak river embankments and open riverbanks, which is already causing floods in Jowhar. [(OCHA, 17 May 2021)](https://reliefweb.int/node/3738815)\n\nThe ongoing Gu\u2019 rains have significantly reduced with many parts of Somalia receiving below average cumulative amounts over the last week.

However, the rains received triggered flash floods in some areas and will affect food security and livelihoods, with the 2021 Gu\u2019 season cereal production expected to be 20-40% below average.

Per the initial reports, approx. 4,400 families were affected currently being assessed by joint teams. ([IFRC, 16 May 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3739691))\n\nA total of 7,896 people affected by flood were identified by interagency assessment teams to receive humanitarian assistance in Obe district, Hirat province and Jawand district, Badghis province. Aid agencies will provide food, cash, relief items, emergency shelter and hygiene kits to people in need. Water, sanitation and hygiene partners will support the restoration of damaged water sources in affected areas. ([OCHA, 2 Jun 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3743656/))\n\nHeavy rainfall in north-eastern Afghanistan (especially Nuristan Province) over the last 48 hours, has caused flash floods.

Over the next 24 hours, moderate rainfall is forecast over north-eastern Afghanistan, including Nuristan Province. ([ECHO, 30 Jul 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3760647))\n\nIn late night of 28 July 2021, massive flash floods, triggered by heavy rain, occurred in Mirdesh village in Kamdesh district in Nuristan province \u2013 eastern part of Afghanistan. As per the initial field reports, around 150 lives are lost with 113 dead bodies found as of 31 July 2021 \u2013 others were still missing. Around 300 residential houses are impacted with 200 houses fully damaged. One public bridge and four small bridges are also damaged. The water also swept away cattle, destroyed agricultural lands and also demolished a large part of a road in Kamdesh district. ([IFRC, 5 Aug 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3762300))\n\nIn response to severe flooding that took place on 29 July in Maherdish Village in Kamdesh District, Nuristan Province, UN assistance was dispatched and distributed to 1,631 people. The aid included relief items, shelter supplies, tarpaulins, a two month supply of emergency food, and nutritional supplies for women and children. ([OCHA, 8 Aug 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3763201))\n\nOn 30 August, heavy rains and floods were reported in Helgal valley, Ghazi Abad area in Sheltan, Ghazi Abad, Nari and Shigal districts in Kunar Province which inflicted damage to roads, bridges, livestock as well as farmlands. Also, 105 people reportedly were affected by flash floods in Behsud District in Jalalabad city in Nangarhar province. Interagency assessment teams were deployed to affected area to assess humanitarian needs. ([OCHA, 5 Sep 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3772968/))\n\nSince the massive flash floods in Nuristan Province that occurred in the late night of 28 July, the Afghan Red Crescent Society (ARCS) had conducted a damage and needs assessment in Kamdesh district \u2013 a remote area that was then not under government control. Based on updated figures tabulated by 1 August, in addition to the loss of more than 260 lives, nearly 30 business premises, 3 mosques, and 7 bridges were destroyed, as well as water and electricity infrastructure and over 360 hectares of agricultural land and 3,200 fruit trees. The floods risks of Nuristan remain - recently, flash flood warnings for Nuristan were also issued by the Civil Aviation Authority Meteorological Department. Coupled with the remoteness of the village and devastation from the flash floods of 28 July, the areas continue to require immediate humanitarian assistance for disaster relief and early recovery. ([IFRC, 5 Nov 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3789441/))\n\nEven though it has been more than five months since the devastating floods in early May, the situation in Afghanistan has complicated the early recovery processes of the affected communities, and environmental threats remain due to reduced coping mechanisms. With winter already having started, humanitarian assistance is assessed to be still needed for floods-affected households to ensure sustenance through winter and to enhance their resilience for future flash floods.

All ten districts of Suriname (Paramaribo, Nickerie, Coronie, Saramacca, Commewijne, Wanica, Para, Marowijne, Sipaliwini, Brokopondo) have reported flooding in most of their communities. On 24 April, local media reported floodwaters in the\ncommunity of Albina, in Marowijne, reaching knee height. As the persistent rains continued, more regions were impacted. By 27 April, large parts of Wageningen were underwater for days, and the situation worsened when the\nring dam between the Nickerie River and Wageningen broke after a rupture. The main areas flooded are in Commewijne, Wanica, Saramacca, and Nickerie. Flooding has also been reported in Marowijne, especially Albina. In the Pamaaka area, the road from Snesikondre to LangaTabiki had become impassable, making the area inaccessible. \n\nHeavy rains and flooding continued throughout May 2021. Visits by the local authorities revealed that many areas had been flooded for weeks and residents saw little to no reprieve from flood conditions. The NS alerted the IFRC to the ongoing situation in Suriname via an initial GO Report posted on 25 May 2021. \n\nTo date, while floodwaters are receding in some areas, there are still inundated areas. In some areas, floodwaters have reached window height. Thus far, the National Society has been able to report that 10 families have had to leave their homes in Wageningen and were placed in a school used as a collective centre.

The communities living in the riverine areas along Juba and Shabelle rivers are at high risk of flooding. As heavy rains are expected to continue in November and December, scaling up of livelihoods, improving and supporting health services and WASH facilities is vital in order to prevent further deterioration in food security and escalation of the public health crisis.

The floods displaced approximately 1,800 households in Bor South and submerged crops in Duk. The NOAA/NCEP Global Ensemble Forecast System shows a sustained likelihood of heavy rainfall through August 10, 2020, in eastern South Sudan. Although the scale of flooding is lower in 2020 compared to 2019 so far, a consecutive year of flood-induced crop and livestock losses in low-lying areas along the Nile River and Pibor-Akobo-Sobat basin would exacerbate existing food insecurity into the post-harvest period.

([ECHO, 11 Aug 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3660709/))\n\nHeavy rainfall has been affecting central and eastern States of the country (in particular Jonglei, Eastern Nile, and Pibor States) since late July, causing the White Nile River, and the Akobo River to overflow, triggering floods that have resulted in casualties and damage. In Jonglei State, media report as of 14 August, around 200,000 displaced people, and thousands of destroyed houses across Bor South, Twic East, Duk, and Ayod Counties. In the eastern part of Upper Nile State, approximately 30,000 people were reported affected across the Renk County. In Pibor state, a number of families were reported displaced throughout Pochalla County.

Heavy rains have caused rivers to overflow their dykes and banks, flooding vast areas and settlements along the White Nile in the centre of the country.The majority of people displaced moved to higher ground near their homes and plan to return once the flood waters recede. In Bor South, over 33,000 people earlier displaced by conflict and flooding in Twic East and Duk counties to the north have moved west into Awerial county, and are now sheltering in Mingkaman town IDP settlement.

According to data collected by the local Red Cross committees in the concerned divisions, more than 26,402 people have been affected...The forecast and the rainy season which usually lasts until the end of October, raise fears of further loss of human life and significant deterioration of the situation. The climate forecasts of the Climatology and Data Bank Service (part of the Directorate of National Meteorology) which predicted new rainfall by the end of September proved to be correct. In recent days, the region has been hit by new rains thereby worsening the situation in the affected areas. Rainfall was between 40mm and 85mm and the forecast continues to anticipate rain in October. In addition, the maps of the geographical relief of the area which feature flood zones anticipate that the rains in the Logone-and-Chari and Diamar\u00e9 divisions flow into the Mayo-Kani and Mayo-Danay valleys, which are the most at risk due to their geography.

    "description": "On 29 July, heavy rain affected RachaLechkhumi and Kvemo Svaneti, Guria and Imereti Regions of Georgia, mainly Oni Municipality, Lanchkhuti Municipality, and Kutaisi city. On 3 August, heavy rain affected Lagodekhi Municipality, Kakheti Region as well. As a result of the heavy rains, several villages in Oni Municipality are isolated from the outside world - infrastructure, such as roads and bridges connecting the villages, riverbank protections, as well as agricultural lands and fruit trees have been destroyed. The rain (approx. 125mm) suddenly started which caused serious damages in the Municipalities. Through 29-30 July, as well as on 4 August, the Local Government of the affected Municipalities officially approached the Georgia Red Cross Society with the request to support the affected population with the distribution of basic food and hygiene kits. The items will be delivered to the isolated villages by helicopter of the National Authorities. Besides the damages mentioned above; yards, entrances, basements and first floors of many houses and buildings have been flooded in affected Municipalities. Three houses have been totally destroyed in Lanchkhuti Municipality (Guria Region). All three families were evacuated, and the local Government provided temporary shelter/houses to them. ([IFRC, 12 Aug 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3661117))\n\nOn 21 August, heavy rains caused flooding in Lentekhi Municipality, Racha-Lechkhumi and Kvemo Svaneti Region. Five villages (Durashi, Esieri, Sakdari, Mutsdi and Tvibi), 55 families are isolated from the outside world. Flooded rivers - Mukhra and Cholshura, destroyed the bridges. Houses, agricultural lands are also flooded. This region is the same that is targeted by the already ongoing IFRC operation, but the rain affected another Municipality this time. On 23 August, heavy rain caused flooding in Imereti \u2013 Kutaisi and Tskaltubo Municipalities, Kakheti region-Lagodekhi and Sagarejo Municipalities and Adjara Autonomous Republic - Batumi. First floors and basements of the houses are flooded and roads are destroyed. The Government is currently evaluating and calculating the damage caused by the disaster. Currently no water contamination is reported in the communities as the government was actively working to repair the damaged water pipes. Currently there is no risk of disease spread in the affected communities. ([IFRC, 31 Aug 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3666071))\n\nOn 1 October, heavy rains caused serious flooding in Batumi, Autonomous Republic of Adjara, inflicting damage to 146 households, (584 individuals) in addition to the 50 households (200 individuals) already affected by July-August disasters.

    "description": "Heavy rains in Sudan have intensified over the past week, causing flooding, destruction of infrastructure, houses and livelihoods, and leading to displacement in multiple locations across the country. Khartoum, Blue Nile and River Nile are amongst the most affected states. Floods have also led to damages and affected people in other regions, including El Gezira, West Kordofan and South Darfur. In the Blue Nile State, the state with highest number of people affected so far, the Bout Earth Dam, in Tadamon locality, exceeded its full capacity and collapsed, following the strong rainfall received on 29 July. At least 12 neighbourhoods downstream in Bout Town were flooded due the incident, affecting around 3,900 people. Most of them were rendered homeless and are now sheltering with host families, as nearly 190 houses were destroyed and 590 damaged, according to Government\u2019s Humanitarian Aid Commission (HAC). More houses are expected to collapse, as the rains continue in a zone where the land is already extremely wet. ([OCHA, 3 Aug 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3658542)).\n\nHeavy rain continues to affect 14 of the 18 States, causing widespread floods and leading to an increasing number of casualties and damage. According to UN OCHA, at least 1,100 people have been displaced (600 in North Darfur, and 500 in White Nile State) and more than 50,000 people affected. In addition, media report 10 deaths, 3 injured and more than 3,000 houses destroyed or damaged. National authorities and humanitarian partners are monitoring the situation and are providing relief to those affected. For the next 24 hours, more heavy rain is expected across southern States. Sudan's Meteorological Authority has warned that more heavy rain is expected over August and September, which risks leading to further flooding and displacement. ([ECHO, 7 Aug 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3659785))\n\nAn estimated 125,000 refugees and internally displaced people have been affected in total, particularly in East Sudan, White Nile, Darfur and Khartoum, many in urgent need of shelter and other emergency assistance. Rains have been particularly heavy in North Darfur, leaving an estimated 35,000 IDPs, locals and refugees in need of help, and where 15 people have tragically died and a further 23 gone missing. ([UNHCR, 1 Sep 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3666438))\n\nAs of 8 September, [there were] nearly 100 fatalities, 46 injured people, thousands of people displaced (and many of them sheltered in schools), and over 100,000 houses destroyed or damaged across the aforementioned States. Since mid-July, around 506,000 people have been affected across 17 States (out of 18), with more than 110,000 of them during the first week of September. In the Khartoum State around 100,000 people are currently in need of urgent shelters, household supplies, clean water, sanitation, and health services. Over the next 24 hours, moderate rain is forecast over south-west and south-east Sudan, with locally heavy rain over central North Kordofan State. ([ECHO, 9 Sep 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3668741))\n\nAt least 111,000 houses were either destroyed or severely damaged by floodwater and the number of people critically affected exceeds 770,000. Nearly 16,000 latrines were destroyed and the collapse of the Bout Dam hinders access to water to more than 100,000 people in Blue Nile State, but all 18 States of the country have been affected. There is a need for food, shelter, hygiene and sanitation items to assist those affected. Two weeks ago, the Government declared a State of Emergency in the country due to the unprecedented flooding. Light to locally moderate rain is forecast over southern Sudan on 22-23 September. ([ECHO, 22 Sep 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3672284))\n\nRains started to subside and flood waters are receding in Sudan, after months of heavy rainfall that left more than 875,000 people affected by unprecedented flooding. Torrential downpours, landslides, flash and riverine flooding have killed over 150 people and left a path of destruction in all states across the country, according to the Government's Humanitarian Aid Commission data. More than 30 per cent of the water samples analyzed across 13 states were contaminated and the extensive damage to hundreds of water sources, the collapse of several thousands of latrines increase the likelihood of disease outbreaks. Over 10 million people are now at risk of contracting water-borne diseases, and more than 4.5 million are exposed to vector-borne diseases, an increase of nearly 100 per cent if compared with April 2020.

FAO\u2019s Somalia Water and Land Information Management (SWALIM) reported heavy rains in Somaliland where on 26 April, Lughaye and surrounding areas received unusually heavy rains of 102mm. On 23 April, heavy rains were also received within the Juba river basin. SWALIM forecasts increased rainfall activity in most areas in Somalia and in the Ethiopian highlands in the coming week, which is likely to keep the water levels high in the Shabelle and Juba rivers. The flooding has started barely four months after heavy Deyr (October-December) rains inundated parts of Somalia, affecting over half a million people; and as the country works to contain the COVID-19 virus, which is exponentially rising and has already infected several hundreds of people. The country is also working to contain a desert locust infestation. [OCHA, 24 Apr 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3618914))\n\nSince 20 April, heavy rain has been affecting most of Somalia States and territories (particularly South West, Jubaland, Banadir, Puntland, and Somaliland) as well as the neighbouring central and south Ethiopia since 24 April, causing rivers to overflow and triggering floods that have resulted in casualties and damage. The worst affected area is the Juba river basin and the Shabelle river basin. In Somalia, as of 29 April, media report 10 fatalities, a number of missing people, around 20 injured people, hundreds more displaced, as well as damage to infrastructure in Qardho Town (Bari Region, west Puntland). ([ECHO, 29 Apr 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3625054))\n\nThe number of people affected by flooding in Somalia has risen to 546,103, of whom 216,895 people have been displaced from their homes and 16 others killed since the Gu\u2019 rains started in early April. At least 27 districts are inundated; the worst being Belet Weyne in Hiran region where riverine flooding has displaced more than 115,000 people, according to the district flood taskforce. This includes about 91,000 people who have been displaced from the four sections of the town and 23,220 people from 23 riverine villages. The flooding resulted from a sharp rise in the level of the Shabelle river following heavy rains in Somalia and the Ethiopian highlands. According to the taskforce, more people were fleeing their homes as river levels rise. As of 10 May, the river levels reached 7.93 meters which is 0.37 meter below the bank full level of 8.30 meters. ([OCHA, 11 May 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3633360))\n\nOngoing flash and riverine flooding in Somalia has affected about 918,000 people, of whom 412,000 have been displaced and 24 killed, in 29 districts, as of 16 May. The risk of disease outbreaks is high due to crowding in areas where displaced people are seeking temporary shelter. ([OCHA, 16 May 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3635539))\n\nAs of 19 May, ongoing flash and riverine flooding in Somalia has affected about 919,000 people, of whom 412,000 have been displaced and 24 killed, in 29 districts. Belet Weyne in Hiraan region is the most affected district after the Shabelle river burst its banks on 12 May, inundating 85 per cent of Belet Weyne town and 25 riverine villages. According to the district flood taskforce, about 240,000 people were displaced from the town and neighbouring villages between 12 and 18 May. In Jowhar district, Middle Shabelle region, riverine flooding has affected more than 98,000 people in 37 locations, bringing the total affected in Hirshabelle to 338,000 people. According to the Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs and Disaster Management in Hirshabelle State, nearly 40 per cent of those affected in Jowhar have been displaced from their homes. The risk of disease outbreaks is high due to overcrowding in areas where the displaced people are seeking temporary. ([OCHA, 5 Jun 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3641339))\n\nFlash and riverine floods have since late June affected an estimated 191,800 people in Hirshabelle, South West and Jubaland states as well as Banadir region. Among those affected, about 124,200 people have been displaced from their homes. Another 5,000 peope are at risk of further displacement in Jowhar, Middle Shabelle. Since May, an estimated 149,000 hectares of farmland have been damaged by floods in 100 villages in Jowhar, Mahaday and Balcad districts, Middle Shabelle region. ([OCHA, 26 Jul 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3658337))\n\nThe latest floods point to a worrying pattern where extreme weather conditions are increasing in frequency and intensity. Prior to June 2020, flash floods and riverine flooding caused by seasonal rains displaced more than 450,000 in the country. With floods in 2018 and 2019 displacing 281,000 and 416,000 persons respectively, the flood-based displacement figures demonstrate a rising year-to-year trend. Somalia\u2019s re-occurring climate related emergencies result in devastating impact on communities who heavily rely on farming and livestock for their livelihood. ([UNHCR, 7 Aug 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3659748))\n\nRiverine flooding continues to displace people and inundate farmland in rural areas mainly along the Shabelle river valley. The floods, which are attributed to the Hagaa seasonal rains, have affected nearly 500,000 people since late June in Hirshabelle, South West and Jubaland States, as well as Banadir region.

    "description": "Since 21 November, Djibouti has experienced heavy rains which triggered flash floods across the country. In Djibouti city alone, initial estimates indicate that over 30,000-40,000 families (150,000-250,000 people) have been somewhat affected by the floods, and 9 people (7 children) have reportedly been killed. Reports indicate that between 21 and 24 November, almost 300mm of rain were recorded in Djibouti city alone, or over three times the annual average. Dwellings, shops, schools and infrastructure have been damaged. In some neighborhoods, access to electricity was also interrupted. In other areas of the country, damages to roads and flash floods have affected access to several communities, and information available to date indicate that at least 300 families are now in need of urgent humanitarian assistance in Tadjourah region alone. The recently inaugurated Tadjourah-Balho road, and road between Djibouti and Tadjourah suffered severe damages. A bridge in Arta area (PK53) is in danger of collapsing.

River levels at Belet Weyne (Shabelle) are currently very high and the trend is expected to continue reaching over bank in the coming few days. Along Juba, the river levels are also high. The cumulative rainfall forecast for the coming week is calling for moderate to heavy rains across the country as well as the Ethiopian highlands. The river levels will therefore continue to rise with a high risk of flooding along the entire two channels. Flash floods are expected in built-up and low lying areas of Bay, Bakool and central regions given the forecast. ([FAO, 18 Oct 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3354633))     \n\nLatest reports received in the evening of 21 October indicate that nearly 40 per cent of Belet Weyne town has been affected by flooding with an estimated 72,000 people having moved to Ceel Jaale highlands and surrounding areas. All villages in the north of Belet Weyne town have been affected and humanitarian partners are yet to establish the number of people displaced in these areas. The situation is further compounded by flooding from an outburst of minor tributaries in Belet Weyne, which has caused damage to farmland in villages such as Hawo Taako. Significant portions of crop land were also flooded in Bardheere in Gedo region, (where the river is already at bank full) and Bualle. Riverine communities have been asked to vacate their homes to higher ground with immediate effect.

Furthermore, the floods have caused significant damage to the agricultural and farming sectors thus pausing a threat to food security. As of 4 November 2019, 17 353 people were affected and 3 913 homes were destroyed. The villages of Liboko, Eboko and Ikpembele were the most affected.

Populations within the commune of Zina have been forced to leave villages, although the scale of displacement from the floods is not clear.

These torrential rains caused heavy human and material damages in all three districts of the Wilaya namely S\u00e9libaby, Ould Yenja and Ghabou.

    "description": "A wave of heavy rainfall and thunderstorm has hit the south western region of Libya. The rainfall commenced on the 28 May 2019 and intensified on the 2 June. The municipality of Ghat has been severely affected, including: Silila, Ta\u2019ala, Ghat, Albakat, Saya, Alfiywat, Al-Sharika and Al-Siniyah. The rainfall and thunderstorm are expected to continue, decreasing in intensity in the coming days. The water levels have not receded and vary between 0.5 to 2 meters depending on the area. The municipality activated the Emergency Cell consisting of local authorities, police and the Libyan Red Crescent.\n\nAccording to the local counterparts, over 20,000 people have been affected by the floods and an estimated 2,500 have been displaced to nearby areas. Most of the displaced families are hosted with relatives or sheltered in three schools habilitated by the municipality. Human casualties have been reported. To date, four died (including three children and one adult) and 30 people suffered minor injuries.\n\nSevere damage to infrastructure and farmland vital for livelihoods were reported. Ghat hospital was partially flooded and service provision has been affected. The official exams for elementary and middle school scheduled for next week have been postponed. There is a risk of running out of fuel and domestic commodities due to the infrastructure damage. The airport remains operational.\n\nThe Emergency Cell reported displaced persons in remote locations who might need temporary accommodation, but numbers are still to be confirmed. Based on the magnitude of damage, they estimate that IDPs will be able to gradually return home within a month\u2019s time. ([OCHA, 5 Jun 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3158254/))",

Sulaymaniyah reported limited displacement, but substantial damage to infrastructure, and flooded agricultural areas. The flooding in the southern governorates was somewhat anticipated, as many of the affected families are residing in low-lying marshland areas, in non-compliance of local laws. These areas are subject to annual inundations during Iraq\u2019s rainy season; however, the floods were heavier in 2019 than in years past.\nMost of the displaced have returned home, but several water treatment plants are offline throughout the country as a result of the floods, disrupting clean water supplies in some governorates. Relevant UN agencies and NGOs who work in the WASH sector responded where necessary with water trucking, provisions of chemicals for water treatment facilities, and sanitation services.\nThe Government of Iraq and Kurdistan Regional Government acted as first responders, with some governorates requesting additional support from humanitarian partners. Assistance being provided includes cholera preparedness, water purification, and emergency medical assistance.

Ninewa bore the brunt of the severe weather, although other governorates were also affected.\nThe storms washed away buildings, roads, and bridges, and flooded IDP camps and urban areas. A temporary state of emergency was declared in Mosul on 2-December after several neighborhoods were inundated and multiple buildings collapsed. Debris clearance and rehabilitation efforts are underway, but concerns about unexploded ordinance (UXO) must be factored into response efforts.\nAfter the initial floods on 22/23 November, camp management in several IDP camps in Ninewa instituted contingency planning which diminished the impact of subsequent storms; however, it is imperative to ensure that all 125 of Iraq\u2019s IDP camps are restored to minimally acceptable standards, including improved flood mitigation measures.

    "description": "Since early August 2018, communities in Northern and Upper East regions of Ghana have been affected by heavy and continuous seasonal rainfalls, which was later exacerbated by the annual opening of the Bagre dam gates. Indeed, the Bagre Dam, located in Burkina Faso, caused unprecedented flooding in many local communities, destroying lives and properties. The Bagre Dam spilled on the 31st of August 2018, when the dam reached its maximum spillage level at 235m on that day. However, by the 10th of September, the dam was still spilling, and water level remained at the maximum level of 235m.\n\nThe continued rise in water levels resulted in flooding which has affected farmlands, posing threat to lives and properties as the spilled water found its way into the Black and White Volta Rivers, which overflowed into the three regions of the north and the Eastern Region. According to an assessment report by the National Disaster Management Organisation (NADMO), about 11,959.6 Hectares of farmland have been affected by the flooding, posing a food insecurity risk to the affected communities.\n\nThe country continues to receive more rains, which contributes to worsening the situation. Several families living close to the banks of the Black and White Volta Rivers, have relocated to other communities for shelter and safety. An initial assessment report produced by NADMO highlights the devastating impact of the floods. Some 23 communities in 2 districts (13 communities in Bakwu West District and 11 communities in Talensi Districts) with a total of 3,556 households (21,336) people have been affected in the Upper East region, whilst in the Northern region 202 communities in 9 districts thus 10,567 people have been affected, leading to a total of 31,903 people (5,317 households) affected in both regions.

Reports indicate at least 23 fatalities with many more injuries. Damage to crops and livestock deaths from flooding occurred in localized areas of West Kordofan, Kassala, and Darfur States. In areas with reported crop damage, households are replanting fields as seasonal rains continue. Areas with no flooding continue to have above-average rainfall with favorable crop development and pasture generation ([FEWSNET, 31 Aug 2018.](https://reliefweb.int/node/2768219))\n\nHeavy rains and consequent flash floods have so far affected more than 142,000 people, damaging households and livelihoods in 14 out of Sudan\u2019s 18 states, West Kordofan, Kassala and Gedaref being the hardest hit. ([OCHA, 19 Aug 2018.](https://reliefweb.int/node/2795019))\n\nWidespread flooding is expected to have lingering livelihood impacts and likely lead to some slight crop production shortfalls, especially in the worst flood-affected regions in the eastern, northern, and western regions of the country. Field reports indicate that poor households in some of these flood-affected areas have replanted fast-maturing sorghum varieties, and their overall performance will rely heavily on the continued moisture in coming months. ([FEWSNET, 5 Oct 2018](https://reliefweb.int/node/2820784))\n\nOver 200,000 people in 15 of Sudan\u2019s 18 states have been affected by heavy rains and flash floods between June and early November, according to the Government\u2019s Humanitarian Aid Commission (HAC).

Roads, bridges, schools and agricultural land has been damaged or destroyed, and most of the affected area remains cut off except by boat. There is an urgent need for food, sanitation and hygiene support, housing repair kits and psychosocial support.\n\nFlood waters caused by the break of Xepien-Xenamnoyu dam in southern Lao PDR are flowing downstream, resulting in the evacuation of more than 5,600 people in Stung Treng Province, northern Cambodia. As of 31 July, no people have been reported dead or missing. The water level at Stung Treng is at 10.7m and forecast to reach flood level within five days.

As of 6 August, the water level is receding slowly, but access to the affected area remains challenging due to floods and mud. Some areas are accessible only by helicopter. Based on the Government\u2019s information, 13 villages have been affected, five are considered severely affected. The Government has declared the affected area as a National Disaster Zone. Current identified needs are water, health, food, shelter and psychosocial support.

([OCHA, 14 Aug 2018](https://reliefweb.int/node/2742304/))\n\nTropical Cyclone Bebinca led to flooding in northern Laos, with impacts also felt in the south of the country. Heavy and consistent rain since 13 August has led to rising river levels in Attapeu province, where the hydro-electric dam collapsed less than a month ago. This is causing flooding and restricting access to Sanamxay, hampering the delivery of aid to areas affected by the dam collapse. Authorities are closely monitoring the level of the Mekong River and its tributaries. ([OCHA, 20 Aug 2018](https://reliefweb.int/node/2750309/))\n\nAs of 6 August, the flood had affected over 13,000 people. Over 6,000 of those have been evacuated to emergency camps.

The Humanitarian Country Team in Lao PDR have selected the six hardest-hit districts in Khammouane province, focusing on lifesaving activities, and have applied to the Central Emergency Response Fund to address the life-threating consequences of the flooding in the province.  ([OCHA, 8 Oct 2018](https://reliefweb.int/node/2820894/))\n\nAccording to Government reports, as of 15 October, more than 2,300 villages, 126,000 families and 616,000 people were reported to be affected by the floods. A total of 16,739 people remains evacuated from their villages. 1,779 Houses were reported as destroyed and 514 as damaged. All schools in Sanamxay are now operating. However, some students irregularly attend in some primary and secondary schools, primarily due to shortages of classrooms, teachers and school meals. ([UNCT Laos/OCHA, 19 Oct 2018](https://reliefweb.int/node/2873548/))\n\nWith the rainy season coming to an end, the disaster damages and losses can be expected to have stabilized.

In addition to the risk associated with access and sanitation, the preparation to the rainy season requires urgent interventions in terms of NFI and retrofitting of unsafe shelter units, through the provision of emergency shelter materials to reinforce the structures against strong winds and rains ([IOM, UNHCR, CCCM Cluster, Shelter Cluster, 5 Sep 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2202414))\n\nOn 4 September, heavy rains have led to flash floods, discharges and river overflowing in Benue State, centre-east Nigeria. Almost 250,000 people are reportedly affected in 21 Local Government Areas. Hundreds of houses have been destroyed and crop fields damaged. The State Government and the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) are setting up two camps in Makurdi, for people who have lost their homes. The Nigerian Red Cross is providing immediate response in terms of food and non-food items. NEMA has requested technical assistance from the international community.\nUNICEF has carried out a quick assessment and is increasing access to drinking water in the two camps. These floods are considered the most severe since 2012. ([OCHA, 6 Sep 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2204709))\n\nWeeks of torrential rainfall led to flash floods, discharges and river overflowing in Benue State, north-central Nigeria, affecting more than 100,000 people across 21 local government areas in the state. The Nigerian Red Cross provided immediate response of food and non-food items. A displacement site which was set up by the State Government and the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) was closed on 9 October and flood victims provided with transport fare to return home.

([OCHA, 29 Jan 2016](https://reliefweb.int/node/1371051))\n\nThe Burundian Red Cross (BRC) continues with the WASH response in the two flood displacement sites in Rumonge province where 1,728 people live, including 975 women and 306 children under five. At the Cashi site, WASH sectoral partner, Norwegian Church Aid (NCA) in coordination with the BRC, constructed additional toilet facilities, which are within the Sphere standards (an average of 19-24 people par cabin). ([UNICEF, 31 Mar 2016](https://reliefweb.int/node/1464306))\n\nThe Bujumbura-rural province is particularly today under a big chock of flooding. The overflowing of Rusizi river due to El Nino torrential rains that hit hills of Rwanda and DR Congo from where it flows caused flooding in many areas of Gatumba zone in Mutimbuzi commune. Many houses are being destroyed leaving behind hundreds of persons homeless. Some schools are also closed and many hectares of fields of crops are under water. Moreover, some areas are inaccessible.

    "description": "Heavy rains in late October have caused flooding in and around Baghdad, as surface drainage is minimal. Sewer systems have overflowed and caused open sewage to mix with floodwaters. The floods also contributed to increased power outages as many power stations were flooded and authorities have reported deaths caused by electrocution. Roads were damaged and drainage systems blocked even days after the rains stopped. The Iraqi Prime Minister on 1 November declared the status of emergency in areas overwhelmed by the heavy rains. \n\nHumanitarian partners estimate that the floods have affected at least 84,000 displaced people staying in more than 40 sites and camps, mostly in Baghdad and Anbar governorates. On 5 November, the rains started in Baghdad again after a few days respite. The number of affected people may rise as partners receive more information about conditions on the ground. Flooding has also been reported from other governorates including Diyala, Salah al-Din and Sulaymaniyah. ([OCHA, 8 Nov 2015](https://reliefweb.int/node/1255066))\n\nAt least 58 people have died in the recent floods, most killed by electrocution in the capital. Roads across the country were cut by the waters and sewage backed up. The downpours were particularly devastating in Baghdad, where crumbling infrastructure, weakened by 30 years of war and endemic corruption, played its part too. This year\u2019s rains also hit northern Iraq, causing flash floods in the Kurdistan cities of Erbil and Sulaymaniyah. Aid workers said water levels reached up 1.5 metres inside some houses.

Since the flood waters have not yet receded, it is impossible yet to quantify the damages or to assess the actual extent of the risk posed to civilians and their livelihoods by the mines and explosives remnants that have likely been displaced outside of already known marked areas.The emergency situation requires a rapid and efficient emergency response, such as providing mine action organisations with the resources and means to carry out risk assessment and to mark out mined areas once again.

The activation of the National Emergency Operations Centre (NEOC) was authorized. Total losses and the total number of people affected by the flooding are yet to be determined. However, based on the 2012 Preliminary Census Report, with more than 70 per cent of the country\u2019s population living along the coastal areas, a significant number of households have been either directly or indirectly affected.

There is a need to address water and sanitation issues, particularly garbage disposal and consumption of potable water and livelihood assistance, as some of the communities depend entirely on livestock and farming and have had their main source of food and\nincome severely affected, so their capacity to meet basic needs has been significantly reduced.

    "description": "Heavy rains caused floods and landslides in several parts of Myanmar since June 2015. On 30 July, Cyclone Komen made landfall in Bangladesh, bringing strong winds and additional heavy rains to the country, which resulted in widespread flooding across 12 of the country\u2019s 14 states and regions (Ayeyarwady, Bago, Chin, Kachin, Kayin, Magway, Mandalay, Mon, Rakhine, Sagaing, Shan, Yangon). On 31 July, the President declared Chin and Rakhine states, and Magway and Sagaing regions as natural disaster zones.\n\nAccording to the National Natural Disaster Management Committee (NNDMC), 125 people were killed and some 1.7 million people were temporarily displaced by floods and landslides. Almost all of the displaced people had returned to their villages of origin by the end of September, leaving only about 10,000 people in evacuation centres (mainly in Sagaing Region and Chin State) awaiting relocation. The Government has said it expects most of these remaining displaced people to return to their villages of origin or to be relocated by the end of October, although a portion of these people may be in temporary accommodation for longer, particularly in the case of people who are going to be permanently relocated to new sites.\n\nThe NNDMC identified Hakha in Chin State, Kale in Sagaing Region, Pwintbyu in Magway Region, and Minbya and Mrauk-U in Rakhine as the five most affected townships where a total of 229,600 people were affected by the floods. According to the Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation, over 1.1 million acres of farmlands have been inundated, with more than 872,000 acres destroyed, as of 4 October. So far, 495,000 acres have since been re-cultivated. Damage to crops and arable land will disrupt the planting season and pose a risk to long-term food security.\n\nWhile the water has receded in most areas, many roads and bridges were destroyed in the worst affected states and regions. The roads in Chin State were particularly badly affected and continue to pose a major logistical challenge for assessments and assistance delivery.\n\nMulti-sectoral Initial Rapid Assessments (MIRA) were conducted in 317 locations of 34 townships in Ayeyarwady, Bago, Chin, Magway, Rakhine and Sagaing, covering close to 200,000 people. Other needs assessments were also carried out in areas not covered by the MIRA assessments in Chin and Rakhine states. According to the Rakhine State Government (RSG), Buthidaung, Kyauktaw, Minbya, Maungdaw and Mrauk-U townships were the most severely affected areas in Rakhine State. In many parts of Rahine State, floods and salt water severely damaged the paddy fields. A major concern remains water contamination, as most villages use water ponds for drinking water and many ponds were flooded and contaminated.([OCHA, 4 Nov 2015](https://reliefweb.int/node/1248751))\n\nSix months on from the devastating floods that struck Myanmar, around 400,000 people have received emergency assistance and support in their recovery from the Myanmar Red Cross Society and its partners in the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement. At their peak the floods affected over 9 million people across 12 of Myanmar\u2019s 14 states and regions. The floods temporarily displaced over 1.7 million people and destroyed 15,000 homes as well as more than 840,000 acres of agricultural crops.\n\nBetween July 2015 and January 2016, over 1,400 Red Cross volunteers and staff from the Myanmar Red Cross Society and Red Cross partners assisted flood affected people across the country. The first phase included evacuations, providing emergency relief such as purified water, food, household items, and shelter materials. Since then, efforts have been focused on supporting the longer term recovery of flood affected communities across the five worst hit regions of Chin, Rakhine, Sagaing, Magway and Ayerwady with livelihood activities, cleaning of contaminated ponds and wells and infrastructure rehabilitation.

    "description": "Heavy rain from a tropical depression, which later became Tropical Cyclone Ita, caused severe flooding in the Solomon Islands at the beginning of April 2014, killing 22 people and affecting and over 50,000. The worst affected area was the capital Honiara after the Mataniko River burst its banks on 3 Apr. Houses were washed away and infrastructure damaged, with an estimated 12,000 people affected. At the peak of the crisis, there were around 10,000 people displaced in nearly 30 evacuation centres in Honiara. By 12 May, 10 evacuation centres still housed 4,477 people. Over 9,000 households in Honiara, Guadalcanal and Isabel had lost 75 to 100 per cent of their food gardens. Drinking water remained a concern for an estimated 50 per cent of the 50,000 people affected. ([OCHA, 12 May 2014](https://reliefweb.int/node/660189))\n\nThe National Disaster Council endorsed the [Humanitarian Action Plan (HAP)](https://reliefweb.int/node/657886) on 24 Apr, which requires US$13.6 million for three months. Priority areas are health, WASH, shelter, protection and food security.\n\nAs of 22 May, over 2,500 people remained in eight evacuation centres in Honiara. Flood-affected health facilities and schools were still in need of repair. ([OCHA, 22 May 2014](https://reliefweb.int/node/662190))\n\nBy 25 Jun, over 1,000 people remained in three evacuation centres in Honiara. A Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) grant totaling $1.8 million has been approved to support Health, Nutrition and WASH activities. A revision of the Humanitarian Action Plan focusing on early recovery is underway. ([OCHA, 25 Jun 2014](https://reliefweb.int/node/670565))\n\nThe total number of people reached through this operation exceeded the target that was set in the Emergency Appeal. In all, some 66,000 people were reached with water, sanitation and hygiene promotion, as well as health activities; 1,428 households received emergency shelter kits and 2,878 households received household kits.\nHowever it is recognized that there may be some overlap in the beneficiary figures. Beneficiaries (especially within evacuation centres) would have received water, sanitation and hygiene promotion activities, and also received either a household kits or emergency shelter kits. This scenario, coupled with the continual movement of people in flood affected communities and their very limited means to identify themselves, resulted in challenges for data recording.

As of 8 Nov, waters had receded in the majority of the provinces, although extended areas remained flooded particularly in Banteay Meancheay and Battambang, as well in the central provinces like Kampong Cham and Prey Veng.

With the recession of waters, people resumed their livelihood activities, in particular farming. Compared to the events in 2011, floods in 2013 appear to have been less extensive in scale, although in some provinces the impact \u2013 including number of evacuated families, damaged crops, damaged infrastructure - was more significant due to a combination of factors such as: unexpected gravity of the floods, both in extent and intensity, longer time for waters to recede, repeated floods and flash floods, limited preparedness undertaken in advance, limited early warning.

The situation was also exacerbated by passing typhoons Jebi and Monghut, which brought further rainfall to the region. \n \nOn 16-19 Sept, a tropical depression crossed over Lao PDR bringing prolonged heavy rainfall to four districts in the south, which suffered the worst impact of the floods. It is recorded as the worst flooding in the south of the country in the last 35 years. On 30 Sep, [Typhoon Wutip](https://reliefweb.int/disaster/tc-2013-000122-vnm) hit Viet Nam and moved in over central Lao PDR.\n\nIt was estimated that over 350,000 people were affected by floods throughout the country. The floods also caused massive damage to transport, infrastructure, education and agriculture. Over 15,000 hectares of rice fields were damaged and thousands of livestock killed. Seven bridges and nearly 1,200km of roads were damaged in addition to irrigation systems, latrines, wells and reservoirs. More than 60 schools were reported to be damaged, with the loss of equipment and books. \n\nAs of 6 Nov, the flood waters in affected provinces had receded and the situation was expected to continue improving.

Major infrastructures such as a hospital and sewage treatment unit have also been damaged. ([IFRC, 17 May 2013](https://reliefweb.int/node/576896))\n\nDuring the operation URCS worked together with the local authorities and the specialized agency for emergencies, especially the Office of the Prime Minister (OPM). URCS distributed a total of 3,300 shelter and NFI kits (including tarpaulins, cooking pots, cups, plates, blankets, jerry cans, laundry soap, and mosquito nets) for 3,425 households and reached 24,062 of the affected people. URCS also provided psycho-social support to internally displaced persons (IDPs) both in the camps and for the affected families staying with host families. URCS also provided overall camp management activities in the settlements for the displaced. However, camps were later closed and IDPs encouraged to reside with hosting communities, where they continued to receive support from URCS and other relief agencies.

([UN Resident Coordinator, 20 Mar 2012](https://reliefweb.int/node/564075))\n\nThe initial [Response and Recovery Proposal](https://reliefweb.int/node/555506) issued in January sought $30.6 million to enable humanitarian partners to support the Government in addressing the needs of 150,000 flood-affected persons in Gaza Province for the period of six months. As of 24 Apr, a total of $19 million was contributed, covering 97.8% of all the humanitarian relief needs. However, only $4.3 million was received to cover early recovery activities.

The heavy downpours resulted in landslides, collapsed bridges, loss of livestock and contamination of rain water tanks, isolating many areas and impeding the evacuation of affected communities. Four people were killed and 83 were severely injured. 174 houses were completely destroyed, 307 houses lost their roofs and 1,774 were flooded. 64,987 people (8% of the total population) were directly affected by the floods (17,232 in Grande Comore; 30,063 in Anjouan and 17,592 in Moh\u00e9li). Another 80,000 people in Moroni and 3,900 in Mitsoudje were indirectly affected by broken water pumps.\n\nMost small scale farmers lost their crops, which typically included bananas, coconuts, sweet potato, vanilla and cloves, as a result of the extensive damaged caused by rocks and debris as a result of the flooding. The floods covered the affected land with stones and sand, and resulted in hydro-geography changes in the landscape, opening new water ways, which poses a risk in terms of future floods.\n\nSix months after the flooding, the situation in the country had improved significantly. Nevertheless, water quality remained a concern especially for households who are using water tanks. ([IFRC, 3 Dec 2013](https://reliefweb.int/node/620350))\n### Appeals & Response Plans\n\n- [![Govt.

The National Administration declared a state of emergency on 29 Mar 2012 and extended it on 28 May for an additional 60 days. In the eastern regions, the Amazon River reached the historical level of 118.59 masl (metres above sea level) in March, resulting in floods which severely affected the region of Loreto, particularly the Bel\u00e9n, Iquitos, Punchana and San Juan districts, and approximately 31 per cent of the total population. By 25 Jun, the National Civil Defence Institute reported 222,633 severely affected persons, 73,259 affected persons, 3,454 uninhabitable homes, 59,930 affected homes, 1,584 affected schools, 51 affected health centres as well as the loss of 26,187 hectares of productive land in the department of Loreto.

    "description": "Between late September and early December 2011, the Mekong Delta region of Viet Nam experienced its worst flooding in 11 years, affecting over 600,000 people in the provinces of An Giang, Dong Thap, Long An, Can Tho, Vinh Long, Hau Giang and Kien Giang. Unlike the floods Viet Nam faces every year, these floods have been slow onset, with water covering large areas, paralysing the everyday life of affected communities and threatening their livelihoods. 85 people were killed; almost 13,000 families were evacuated due to flooding and landslides. Damage to property and livelihood was widespread and as much as 11,768 acres of rice paddies were lost. Six months on, some households made, where possible, efforts to rebuild their houses; however, many families whose houses had totally collapsed were still living in temporary shelters nearby their destroyed houses or continued to live in their bamboo houses with poor conditions.

Thailand's biggest province, Nakhon Ratchasima, was worst-hit, with three deaths, thousands of homes flooded as well as a hospital, which was forced to evacuate patients in critical condition. \n\nBy October, the governors of the affected provinces had declared the situation a disaster ([IFRC, 27 Oct 2010](http://www.reliefweb.int/node/372443)).  In response,  CHF 356,617 was allocated from the IFRC\u2019s disaster relief emergency fund (DREF) to support the national society. A total of 136,662 affected families in 44 provinces were assisted through the provision of relief kits by the Thai Red Cross Society using both funding raised domestically and from the DREF allocation. Over the course of the disaster, the DDPM reported that a total of 8,970,653 people were affected, 258 people had died and 7,784,368 rai of farmland had been damaged as a result of the flooding.

    "description": "July 2010 marked a particularly tragic period in Pakistan\u2019s history. In the north, three days of unstoppable rain caused the Indus River to swell, creating a massive body of water that moved from the Himalayas, southwards to the Arabian Sea. The disaster became more destructive than the Haiti earthquake and the Japan tsunami combined. ([PHF 31 July 2011](https://reliefweb.int/node/463996/))\n\nThe monsoon rains that lashed Pakistan from the end of July through August 2010 caused the country\u2019s worst flooding since 1929. The northwest of the country, particularly the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, was the first area to be affected. The situation deteriorated with the passing weeks as flooding spread to two other major food-producing provinces, the Punjab and Sindh, both densely populated, in August and September.  ([HI 20 July 2011](https://reliefweb.int/node/438619/))\n\nOut of a population of 168 million, at least 20 million people were affected by the floods, losing their homes and livelihoods, mainly across the provinces of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Punjab, and Sindh. The floods also affected people in Balochistan, Gilgit-Baltistan, and Pakistan-Administered-Kashmir. More than 1700 people died, more than 7 million were left homeless and at least 1.8 million homes were destroyed. Over 2.4 million hectares of standing crops were submerged, and 450,000 heads of livestock lost. ([PHF 31 July 2011](https://reliefweb.int/node/463996/))\n\nWithin a period of one and a half months, 78 districts out of Pakistan\u2019s 141 districts were affected, and as of 24 October 2010, the government\u2019s National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) reported that there had been 1,985 deaths and 2,946 people injured by the floods. Out of the estimated 22.2 million hectares of agricultural land, almost two million hectares were destroyed in the floods, threatening severe food shortages in the coming months. More than 400 hospitals and health clinics were damaged or destroyed, as well as education facilities, power and transmission lines, telecommunication networks and industrial infrastructure. ([IFRC 2 Nov 2013](https://reliefweb.int/node/613053/))\n\n**Punjab**\n\nIn Punjab, the breadbasket of Pakistan, experienced a combination of flash floods in the mountains and highly destructive river flooding in agricultural areas. An estimated six million people were affected across eleven districts. More than 500,000 homes were damaged or destroyed. And more than 1.85 million acres of arable land was washed away. The most severely affected districts were: Muzzafargarh, Rajanpur, Mianwali, R.I. Khan, Layyah, D.G. Khan, and Bhakkar\n\n**Sindh**\n\nThe direct impact of the floods has been the most protracted in Sindh. Close to half of the rural population was affected, with millions evacuated or forced to flee. At the peak of the crisis vast swathes of the province were left underwater, critical because the majority of the people rely on agriculture for their survival. More than seven million people were affected and more than 875,000 homes were damaged or destroyed. More than 2.5 million acres of arable land was submerged, resulting in a problem with nutrition, especially among the young. In March 2011, more than 100,000 people were still in camps or settlements. The most severely affected districts were: Kashmore, Shikarpur, Jacobabad, Larkana, Qambar-Shahdadkot, Thatta, Dadu, and Jamshoro.

In Hiran, Juba and Shabelle river catchments,floods damaged standing crops ([GIEWS, 25 Oct 2010](https://reliefweb.int/node/372876)) Beginning April 2010, heavy rains were received in Hiraan, Lower Shabelle and Lower/Middle Juba regions. Heavy rains in the Juba and Shabelle river catchments in Ethiopia resulted in increased river levels along the two rivers in Somalia. ([OCHA, 16 April 2010](https://reliefweb.int/node/351599/)) By mid May, floods had damaged crops and displaced approximately 100 households in Jamaame, Middle Juba, and another 100 households in Belet Weyne, Hiraan. (([OCHA, 14 May 2010](https://reliefweb.int/node/354622/))\n\nA storm which hit parts of the Puntland coastline and heavy rains in Belet Weyne, resulted in the displacement of an estimated 3000 households in May 2010. ([OCHA, 28 May 2010](https://reliefweb.int/node/356041)), ([OCHA, 18 June 2010](https://reliefweb.int/node/358573/)) In June 2010, floods affected several villages, damaging crops, destroying roads and displacing more than 300 households in Lower Shabelle and Middle Juba. ([OCHA, 04 June 2010](https://reliefweb.int/node/356920/)). In Belet Weyne, response activities continued smoothly benefiting the 3,000 affected households and  as flood waters continued to subside on the Juba and Shabelle Rivers, field reports\nindicated that at least 30 percent of the 3,000 had returned to their homes towards the end of June.

    "description": "From the late night of 18 January 2010 and the following 24 hours, torrential rains hit the Gaza Strip and\nAlmughraqa, causing heavy floods in huge parts of this densely populated and poor area. The situation has been worsened by the flooding of water from the green line area which borders the Gaza Valley.\nAs a result, the Wadi Gaza, a low lying farming area situated to the south of Gaza City and mostly inhabited by Bedouins, was severely affected for an area of an approximate distance of 1,000 meters on both sides, until the Sea of Gaza.\nThe ground was not able to absorb the huge mass of water, which washed away sand, dust, and garbage filling the ground floors of the homes with contaminated dirty water, mud and garbage. Among the worst hit areas was where the poorest of the poor people in the Gaza Strip were located, living in their simple shelters  and houses.  ([IFRC, 27 Jan 2010](https://reliefweb.int/node/342959))\n\nThe Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) declared a state of emergency on 18 Jan 2010 because of the severe weather conditions that caused floods and resulted in significant damages in the Gaza Valley.\nSince the first moment of the flooding, and through its operations room, the PRCS  dispatched its teams and volunteers to the flooded area to evacuate dozens of affected residents and to search for the missing ones.\nIn addition to the natural disaster, Israel  worsened the situation by opening a dam located in the Green Line which borders the Gaza Valley.

Increased precipitation led to floods and mudslides which caused 26 deaths and affected 45,572 families. These heavy rains, flooding and mudslides, according to the Vice-Ministry of Civil Defence, additionally affected 7,000 hectares of crops and 14,000 animals.  \nThe Bolivian government declared a national emergency in January 2010. The National Council for Disaster Reduction and Response (CONRADE) activated the municipal and departmental Emergency Operations Centres (EOC) and the Ministry of Health and Sports (MSD), together with the Departmental Health Services (SEDES), coordinated field missions and response operations.  \nHeavy rains caused major flooding in the departments of Beni, Chuquisaca, Cochabamba, La Paz and Santa Cruz. Red alerts due to increased river levels and flooding were issued in the areas surrounding the Chapare, Chimore, Ichilo and Sajta rivers in Cochabamba department, the Grande river in the Santa Cruz department, the Ibare and Mamore rivers in Beni department and the Bolivar, Chapare, Chimore, Eterazama, La Paz and Sajta rivers in La Paz department. Lower levels of affectation were registered in the departments of Oruro, Potos\u00ed and Tarija. ([IFRC, 27 August 2010](https://reliefweb.int/node/365683))",

Zone 4 in Menik Farm was the most seriously affected with estimates of up to 1,925 shelters damaged or destroyed.

([Govt. of Sri Lanka, 27 Aug 2009](https://reliefweb.int/node/322025/)) On 4 October, the Minister of Resettlement and Disaster Relief Services Rishad Bathiudeen stated that approximately 10,000 IDPs who lived in Zones 2 and 4 of Menik Farm would be relocated to Zone 6, which was less vulnerable to floods during the upcoming monsoons because of its comparatively higher elevation.

    "description": "From 29 January, a weeklong intensive and persistent rainfall caused major damage in the northwest Guadalcanal area from Tamboko to Maravovo (Sahalu ward), which affected an estimated 7,000 people. Ten deaths were confirmed in western Guadalcanal, where heavy rain and steep terrain combined and caused flash floods. Initial assessment reports highlighted damage primarily to food gardens and water supplies. Damage to other infrastructure was limited but several key bridges suffered damage, which necessitated the transportation of supplies to the worst affected areas by sea. ([IFRC, 16 Feb 2009](https://reliefweb.int/node/297867/))\n\nOn 5 February, the Government of Solomon Islands officially requested for international assistance.

    "description": "Heavy rains from 16\u201324 December 2007 resulted in progressively large numbers of affected and displaced people. During the first two days of the rains, the main affected areas were limited to four Divisions in the central region of the Batticaloa District (Koralai pattu and Eravur pattu). By 20 December, additional Divisions (Kiran, Manmunai, Chenkalady, Kattankudy, Vavunatheevu, Vaazhaichcheanai and Vaakarai) experienced flooding, and the number of affected people rose to 15,554. Continued heavy rains from 23\u201324 December caused a significant increase in affected Divisions, which spread from the northern tip of Batticaloa District down to most of the District\u2019s coastline. The population of the affected districts totalled some 250,000, which included more than 40,255 displaced in 37 welfare centres and schools. A break in the rains after 24 December resulted in the return of the majority of families, with only 252 individuals who remained displaced as of 27 December.

([Govt. of Thailand, 3 Nov 2007](https://reliefweb.int/node/248427/)) \n\nHeavy flooding in Narathiwat province prompted officials to declare up to eight districts as disaster zones; some 10,000 families were evacuated ([Govt. of Thailand, 11 Dec 2007)](https://reliefweb.int/node/251764/). On 17 Dec, Yala province declared seven districts as emergency zones with water in some areas having reached 2 metres ([Govt. of Thailand, 17 Dec 2007](https://reliefweb.int/node/252294)). The situation in Betong district, Yala, became critical as water levels reached four metres in Tambon Aiyerweng and submerged residences and shops ([Govt. of Thailand, 20 Dec 2007](https://reliefweb.int/node/252700/)).",

([OCHA, 31 Jan 2008](https://reliefweb.int/node/257013/))\n\nAn estimated 20,000 households were severely affected and 58,000 people displaced. With about 80 percent of crops destroyed by floods, food insecurity was imminent. ([IFRC, 27 Mar 2009](https://reliefweb.int/node/302566/))\n\nThe flooding disrupted delivery of social and economic services like education, health, trade and agriculture which resulted in increased risk of communicable diseases especially as the flood water receded. Malaria and diarrhoeal disease incidences greatly increased by over 30%. \n([WHO, 31 Dec 2007](https://reliefweb.int/node/318627/))",

([Canadian Red Cross, 27 Sep 2007](https://reliefweb.int/node/247706))\n\nUnusually heavy rainfall since July 2007 has led to flooding and waterlogging across a number of districts in eastern and northern Uganda. The Rwizi River in Mbarara (southwestern Uganda) is also reported to have burst its banks. On 19 September, Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni declared a state of emergency in the areas flood-affected areas of Eastern Uganda, which was endorsed by Parliament on 25 September. ([OCHA, 2 Oct 2007](https://reliefweb.int/node/245061))\n\nMore than 650,000 people have lost their homes and some 200 their lives in the worst floods in the history of Africa affecting large swathes of land all over Eastern, Central and West Africa - and the rains are set to continue into November. In East Africa, Ethiopia, Sudan, Uganda, Rwanda, Somalia and Kenya were badly hit. Hundreds of thousands of people have been affected - Uganda around 90,000, in Kenya around 26,000 and in Ethiopia around 100,000. Thousands more have been displaced.

Overall, a total number of 947 beneficiaries (243 families consisting of 463 men and 484 women) in six districts were badly affected. The impact was particularly severe in the districts of Suai, Same, Manatutu, Viqueque and Ermera. A total of 243 households were affected with at least one death recorded as well as severe loss of livelihood, shelter and crops such as rice, corn and green crops. In Suai, about 100 deep wells were contaminated by flood water while many houses in Jumalai were destroyed by landslides. Diarrhoea, malaria and dengue were reported in Suai with similar problems reported in the districts of Manatutu, Ermera and Same as well. ([IFRC, 8 Aug 2008](https://reliefweb.int/node/275316/))",

    "description": "More than 100,000 families were affected by severe flooding which commenced in the middle of August in Northern Thailand's Chiang Mai, Chiang Rai, Lampang, Lamphun, Mae Hong Son, Nakhon Phanom, Nan, Phayao and Tak provinces. Some 2,100 homes and thousands of hectares of crop land were destroyed due to the overwhelming force of runoffs from the Ping River. Torrential rains, which earlier in August hammered Chiang Rai, Chiang Mai and Mae Hong Sorn, inundated more than 4 500 villagers' homes in the three provinces alone, and left 11 people dead.

([IFRC, 13 Jan 2004](https://reliefweb.int/node/140849))\n\nSoon after the Maliana flooding, Hatuodo in the Ainaro disctrict was hit by floods, which affected approximately 450 people and destroyed crops and livestock. Notified by the government's National Disaster Management Unit (NDMO), a CVTL assessment mission supported by local volunteers and local authorities found 15 houses destroyed. Although there were no human casualties, [the effects] remained extensive with many people falling ill with stomach pains and malaria although it was difficult to ascertain whether this is entirely due to the floods.

    "description": "Torrential rain that started on 14 October triggered flash floods and landslides in central Viet Nam. The floods have submerged 57,300 houses, of which 51,860 were in Quang Ngai Province, ruined at least 7,800 ha of rice, of which 6,000 ha were in Binh Dinh Province, and destroyed 231 irrigation systems. ([OCHA, 21 Oct 2003](https://reliefweb.int/node/136228/))\n\nHeavy rainfall during the period of 11\u201314 November 2003 resulted in water levels rising in all rivers from 0.02m to 3.21m. The sudden rise resulted in severe flash flooding in five provinces: Quang Nam, Binh Dinh, Phu Yen, Khanh Hoa and Ninh Thuan. Low-land area flooded, forming a vast lake destroying thousands of hectares of crops and rice fields. The economic loss to Viet Nam is estimated to be VND 371 billion (USD 24 million).

    "description": "Around midnight on Sunday 15 April 2001 heavy flash floods inundated the lowlands around the town of Lepea and Moataa; rivers and streams also overflowed and caused flooding along the Upolu coast from Lepea to Falefa in the east and Siumu in the south. Most schools around Apia, especially those located close to rivers (such as Vaisigano and Vaimoso), temporarily closed for lack of water. The Congregational Senior College near the Vaisigano River was completely covered in mud and the school closed for 2 weeks. As of 30 April, no deaths were reported as a result of the floods. The Samoa Water Authority estimated USD 1.5 million in damages to the water supply system. ([OCHA, 30 Apr 2003](https://reliefweb.int/node/80587/))",

    "description": "Combined cold air currents and strong easterly winds over Thua Thien Hue and stretching as far south as Khanh Hoa, have caused such heavy rainfall that the central provinces of Vietnam are facing a renewed bout of floods. Mean rainfall between 1 to 6 December averaged 300 - 500 mm in Thua Thien Hue province, 600-1000 mm in Quang Ngai, Quang Nam, Da Nang and Khanh Hoa provinces, and in some parts of Quang Ngai and Quang Nam rainfall averaged as much as 2000 mm. The rains caused flash floods in mountainous areas. Notably the Tra Khuc River in Quang Ngai reached levels unsurpassed since 1964 (alarm level III), and river levels in Quang Ngai and Khanh Hoa were higher than any recorded for these provinces over the last 40 years. Since 6 December rainfall has diminished and water levels in rivers flowing through Quang Nam, Quang Ngai, Da Nang and Binh Dinh are now fluctuating around alarm level III, while in the other affected provinces they have descended to alarm level II and below. However, the coastal delta areas of Quang Nam, Quang Ngai and Binh Dinh are still seriously flooded. Details of flooding and inundation in the central provinces are as follows: Quang Nam Province: the provincial capital and four other districts are under water. Hundreds of houses are flooded and tens of thousands of people cannot return to their homes. Evacuees are in need of food, medicine and other basic items. Quang Ngai Province: 15 communes situated in delta districts and 58 communes in mountainous districts are inaccessible to relief workers. Binh Dinh Province: Hoai Nhon District and areas surrounding Quy Nhon City have been isolated by flood waters. ([OCHA, 7 Dec 1999](https://reliefweb.int/node/56964))\n\nTo date, 115 people have died, over 5,390 houses have been swept away and over 397,000 are reported to have suffered serious damage. The situation is the worst in Quang Nam and Quang Ngai provinces. Over 6,000 households had to be evacuated in Quang Nam and over 5,000 households in Quang Ngai. In the provincial capitals of Quang Ngai Town and Tam Ky, in Quang Nam, many areas were under 1 to 2 metres of water. In Quang Ngai virtually all paddy fields were inundated with 2.5 to 3.5m of water. Many remote areas are still inaccessible. In Thua Thien Hue over 54,000 houses were flooded, but the situation is reported as \"being under control\". In the provinces of Binh Dinh, Phu Yen and Khanh Hoa tens of thousand of households have been flooded and infrastructure and telecommunications has suffered severe damage. For the second time in a month, people have been forced to flee their homes and seek shelter under plastic sheeting distributed by the Vietnam Red Cross (VNRC) and the authorities, their blankets, clothing and food reserves washed away or destroyed by mud. For a second time, their livelihoods have been destroyed. Their paddy fields -- in some cases replanted with their few remaining resources or through relief handouts or loans -- have once again been swamped. They will surely miss the next cropping season, which must be completed in three weeks' time. The longer-term effect is a potential food deficit within the region, but more significantly, a shortage of food among many poor families for the next three to nine months seems inevitable.

    "description": "Vietnam's seasonal flooding began with Storm No. 9 (Eve) hitting the Central Provinces between 18th and 20th October. This affected eight provinces - Thanh Hoa, Nghe An, Ha Tinh, Quang Binh, Quang Tri, Thua Thien Hue, Quang Ngai and Binh Dinh. Throughout the latter part of the month, flood water levels continued to rise on several major rivers in the central provinces, to above Alarm Levels II and III. [...] Heavy rainfall has continued to saturate the six central provinces of Quang Binh, Quang Tri, Thua Thien Hue, Quang Nam, Quang Ngai and Binh Dinh with between 300 - 500mm of rain over the last few days. On the 1st and 2nd of November, flood levels have exceeded Alarm Level II and III in the central provinces from Nghe An to Binh Dinh. Flood water level on the Huong River in Hue was 5.38m, 1.86m above Alarm Level III, about 0.5m above the historic level in 1983 and is predicted to rise by a further one full metre in the coming 24 hours. The streets of the historic town are flooded to levels of up to three metres in places. Telecommunications have been cut with the province and outlying areas are completely inaccessible. In Quang Nam, the flood water level on the Vu Gia River was 0.56m above Alarm Level III. In Quang Tri, Quang Binh and Binh Dinh, major rivers in each province were at, or above, Alarm Level III. In Quang Ngai, flood water level was 1m above Alarm Level II. Many families are reported to be waiting on the roofs of their houses to be rescued in Hue and other provinces. The historic town of Hoi An is also seriously flooded. By early morning of 2 November, the offices of the Red Cross in Hue and Quang Tri were flooded by over 1m of water in Hue and 0.5m in Quang Tri. No confirmation of the number of lives lost, persons missing or material losses is available at this time, but judging from previous years, figures are likely to be high. ([IFRC, 2 Nov 1999](https://reliefweb.int/node/55394))\n\nOn 5 November the Central Committee for Flood and Storm Control (CCFSC) reported at least 233 deaths resulting from more than a fortnight of flooding in central Vietnam. Accurate figures are impossible owing to interrupted communication lines, but it is known that more than 255,299 houses have collapsed and 15,000 households have been evacuated. At least 6,477 ha of paddy fields have been damaged by the deluge, and 5,588 ha definitively lost. According to the CCFSC, 32,830 tons of food have gone to waste. ([OCHA, 5 Nov 1999](https://reliefweb.int/node/55271))\n\nProvisional statistics provided by the Central Committee for Flood and Storm Control (CCFSC) as of 7 November estimate that 535 people have died as a result of the fortnight's flooding, 324 of whom lived in the province of Thua Thien Hue. Accurate figures are impossible owing to interrupted communication lines, but it is known that more than 8,346 houses have collapsed and another 604,204 others have been affected. 15,000 people have been evacuated. ([OCHA, 9 Nov 1999](https://reliefweb.int/node/55468))\n\nOne month after the worst floods Vietnam has experienced this century, new, extensive floods have been an additional blow to the same region. This second bout of flood occurred just as relief and rehabilitation measures were being undertaken in order to help stabilize the lives of the people affected by the previous floods. According to the update issued by the Central Committee for Flood and Storm Control (CCFSC) on 8 December, the new floods caused by heavy rainfall from 1 to 6 December once again attained historical water levels in some rivers in the central provinces from Thua Thien Hue to Khanh Hoa, unsurpassed in the last 40 years. Quang Ngai and Quang Nam are the two most seriously affected provinces; here rainfall averaged as much as 2,000 mm and caused destructive inundation. On 7 December the rainfall diminished and floodwater levels in all the rivers of the central provinces have been receding. According to the Hydro-Meteorological Service forecast, floodwater levels in the rivers flowing through Quang Ngai and Binh Dinh will remain at alarm level III, while rivers in the other provinces will remain at alarm level II or below.

    "description": "As a result of torrential rains on 7-8 July 1999, three districts in Tajikistan have experienced severe flooding and landslides. The districts are: Ashd and Aini in the Leninabad region, and Jirgatal in the Karategin Valley. Of the three, Ashd is the most severely affected with at least two villages reportedly destroyed. United Nations Resident Coordinator in Tajikistan reports that the Tajik Ministry of Emergencies has conducted an assessment of the situation in Ashd and reports that 18 people have been killed, at least 50 are missing and 23 are injured. The Ministry also reports that 167 houses have been destroyed and that an additional 209 are damaged. In Jirgatal, five people are reported dead. Information on Aini is still pending. ([OCHA, 9 Jul 1999](https://reliefweb.int/node/49395))\n\nTorrential rains from 6 to 12 July 1999 produced severe flooding, landslides and the wash out of fortifying dams of river banks in northern and central Tajikistan. Hundreds of houses, educational and health establishments, hundred kilometres of roads, tens of bridges, power transmission lines, irrigation systems and canals, and other important economic objects were destroyed, mostly in the mountainous and foothill districts in the rural areas of the Republic (Ashd and Aini districts in Leninabad region and Faizabad, Gharm, Ghissar, Jirgatal, Kofarnihon, Leninsky, Tavildara and Varzob districts). The most affected are Ashd and Aini districts in Leninabad region and Jirgatal district in the Karategin valley. According to the latest information provided by the Tajik Ministry of Emergencies, the impact of the floods in the Ashd district is as follows: 18 people have been killed, with only 14 bodies retrieved; 10 people are missing and 23 injured; 316 houses are totally destroyed and 412 damaged leaving correspondingly 1,360 and 2,151 people without shelter, of which 413 people need to be resettled. ([OCHA, 15 Jul 1999](https://reliefweb.int/node/49700))\n\nThe Office of the UN Resident Coordinator in Dushanbe reports that the most seriously affected zone is the Asht District in the Leninabad Region. The heaviest loss in human lives occurred in this area with 20 people killed and two still missing. In addition to extensive damage to the existing infrastructure, more than 3, 800 people are without adequate shelter. The agricultural sector is also hard-hit, undermining the livelihoods and food security of hundreds of families. Although humanitarian agencies have already provided significant assistance, local authorities have indicated that more is urgently required. Of the other affected areas, the most serious emergency needs are in Gharm District, where approximately 1,000 people are without adequate shelter. In Jirgital, approximately 700 people require shelter while in Darvaz District in Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Oblast, approximately 90 people are without adequate homes. Assessments are continuing in the Gharm District and new needs may be reported shortly. Support to the agricultural sector is required in both Kholkhozabad and Jirgital Districts, where thousands of hectares have been destroyed or damaged.

    "description": "The 1999 monsoon arrived early, and from late June onwards, flooding and river erosion have caused significant damage to 41 out of the country's 64 districts. Victims of the 1998 floods (poor village day labourers, farmers and fishermen) were just beginning to recover economically, but are now struggling once again with the loss of livelihoods. In June alone, about 400,000 people were rendered helpless by the first spate of floods that hit nine districts, including the hilly tracts of Chittagong. \n\nThe flood situation worsened in July as major rivers continued to rise due to heavy rains in neighbouring states of India, and soon after in Bangladesh. More low-lying areas submerged one after the other bringing to 18 the total number of districts affected by mid-July. Houses were washed away by sweeping floodwaters as thousands of people rushed for refuge to higher grounds. The worst incident occurred on 12-14 July with the unprecedented collapse of the Gumti river embankment due to the rapid onrush of water from upstream. The collapse of the embankment immediately caused huge flooding in many areas of Comilla district, affecting 470,000 people who were caught totally unprepared. Government records showed this incident alone devastated more than 133,000 acres of rice land, 1,760 kms of road, and destroyed 41,386 houses.\n\nAs of 23 September 1999, reports compiled by the Bangladesh Red Crescent Society (BDRCS) local units and verified in the media, the number of flooded districts has risen to 41 while the number of people affected swelled to 3.5 million, a large majority of whom were rendered homeless. Further unconfirmed reports received from BDRCS local units showed: 19 confirmed dead; 1,100,000 acres of crops damaged; 126,000 houses damaged; 1,509 kms of roads damaged; 1,622 kms of embankment damaged; and 922 bridges/culverts damaged.

Six persons were reportedly killed. ([OCHA, 26 Apr 1999](https://reliefweb.int/node/46156))\n\nUnusually heavy rains for this time of year and violent thunderstorms along the western and south-western coast of Sri Lanka between 16 and 21 April caused widespread damage and severe floods in the south-west and south of the country. The main rivers, Kelani and Kalu, rose by over seven feet, and caused additional flooding, made worse by slow run-off. Some of the worst areas received as much as 290 mm of rain in 24 hours, and even the capital, Colombo, where 284 mm fell within 24 hours, experienced bad flooding in many sectors of the city. The worst affected districts are Ratnapura, Colombo, Kalutara, Gampaha, Galle, Kandy, Matara and Kegalle, all located between the coast and the Kandyan highlands. Six persons were reported killed by lightning, landslides or floods. Thousands of houses were damaged or destroyed, and initial official figures place the number of homeless at around 75,000 families. [...] In Colombo alone an estimated 12,400 families were affected. The damage is reportedly much worse in the rural areas particularly in Ratnapura District. ([IFRC, 29 Apr 1999](https://reliefweb.int/node/46380))",

The heavy rains caused serious flooding in four major provinces in the Southern island of Mindanao. Flood waters in some places rose to over 10 feet, cutting off major centres and towns. Landslides and collapsed bridges have compounded the disaster. The government has declared a state of emergency, blaming indiscriminate logging and loss of forest cover as a main factor in causing the flood. The worst affected provinces are: Agusan del Norte, Agusan del Sur, Surigao del Norte and Surigao del Sur. All the 14 towns of Agusan del Sur are under water, displacing over 170,000 people. The National Disaster Co-ordinating Council estimates the total damage at USD 3.2 million. ([IFRC, 10 Feb 1999](https://reliefweb.int/node/4006519))\n\nThe United Nations Resident Coordinator in Manila reported that, according to a Progress Report issued by the National Disaster Coordinating Council (NDCC) on 25 February, flash floods occurred along the Lampan river on 21 February. The floods were caused by continuous rains in the province of Lanao del Norte in Mindanao. 575 families, or 2,609 persons, were affected in the towns of Kauswagan, Linamon and Bacolod. The floods left a death toll of 13 people, with 21 people missing and 79 injured. In addition, 203 houses were totally destroyed and 167 were partially damaged.

    "description": "According to the United Nations Resident Coordinator in Colombo, the northeast monsoon brought heavy rains in the eastern part of Sri Lanka with the dawn of the New Year. 29,288 families in seven administrative districts, namely Trincomalee, Vavuniya, Batticaloa, Polonnaruwa, Ampara, Badulla and Mannar, were affected by heavy floods. Two deaths had been reported to the Ministry of Social Services (MSS), the lead agency of the Government, which has been providing relief to the affected people. A larger number of people have been reportedly affected in Mulaitivu district. IFRC reported that damage to paddy fields was thought to be significant and that the traditional irrigation system of tanks and reservoirs (approximately 20,000 throughout the island) had been damaged by the floods in certain areas. Adverse weather conditions were also reported from Matale, an area in the central hills of Sri Lanka. On 4 January, strong winds with heavy rainfall caused damage to a number of homes and telecommunication facilities. Two deaths due to fallen trees were reported. A similar incident of strong winds had been reported in Ratnapura, the southern part of the hills. ([OCHA, 11 Jan 1999](https://reliefweb.int/node/42709))\n\nThe heavy and late arrival of monsoon rains at the end of December, 1998 and in early January, 1999 caused serious flooding in seven states of the country, mainly located in lowland areas and along the coastal belt. Close to 31,000 families (approximately 155,000 people) were reportedly affected. Some 15,000 families were initially displaced. As the waters receded they returned to their homes where many found that few belongings remained and houses were damaged or destroyed. [...] In the districts of Batticaloa, Trincomalee and Vavuniya alone, more than 18,500 acres of paddy were lost. A second crop is expected in some locations as early as April and as late as September. In order to survive over the coming lean months, most of the affected people will depend on humanitarian assistance to supplement the meagre income generated from daily labour.

Until mid-August, the region had been suffering from a severe drought. According to the official reports issued by affected provinces to the Standing Office of the Central Committee for Flood and Storm Control (CCFSC) on 26 October 1998, 42 people were killed, 3 were missing and 5 were injured or ill. 294 houses collapsed, 5,724 houses were flooded and 482 houses damaged. More than 11,000 hectares of paddy rice were destroyed. According to news reports, the Government reported on 2 November that the death toll from floods in central Vietnam rose to 52, out of which 17 people had been killed in Binh Dinh province, 14 in Khanh Hoa, 12 in Quang Ngai, 4 in Phu Yen and 5 in Ninh Thuan. The damage has been estimated at VND 191 billion (USD 13.7 million). ([OCHA, 6 Nov 1998](https://reliefweb.int/node/41020))\n\nAccording to the latest update issued by the Standing Office of the Central Committee for Flood and Storm Control (CCFSC), Typhoon Dawn and other tropical storms which hit the central provinces from 11 to 26 November caused extensive flooding and damage as follows (as of 28 November 1998): People killed: 267, People missing: 16, People injured: 92, Houses collapsed: 9,821, Houses flooded/damaged: 470,176, Schools collapsed: 143, Schools flooded/damaged: 1,484, Paddy flooded/damaged: 81,224 ha, Other crops flooded/damaged: 33,708 ha. The economic loss is estimated at VND 1,295 billion (USD 93 million). The flood is reported to be the worst flood since 1975, similar to the historical (record) flood of 1964. According to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), some 2.4 million people have been directly affected by the disaster in the following 15 provinces: Quang Binh, Quang Tri, Thua Thien Hue, Quang Nam, Da Nang, Quang Ngai, Binh Dinh, Phu Yen, Khanh Hoa, Ninh Thuan, Binh Thuan, Dac Lac, Kon Tum, Lam Dong and Gia Lai. Some of the provinces are the poorest in the country, and the populations are largely reliant on subsistence agriculture and aquaculture. The damage to crops, infrastructure (including transportation system, bridges, schools, aquaculture, boats, stocks) and private property will seriously affect the living conditions of local residents in 1999.

    "description": "The UN Resident Coordinator in New Delhi reports that a massive landslide, triggered by incessant rains, wiped out Malpa village in Pithoragarh district of Uttar Pradesh on 18 August 1998. At least 180 people, including 60 Kailash-Mansarovar pilgrims and eight Indo-Tibet Border Police personnel were feared killed. The pilgrims were staying in a camp when the landslide occurred between Zipti and Sia lake in Kumaon hills, at around 3 a.m. Among those believed killed were 14 women pilgrims and six employees of the Kumaon Mandal Vikas Nigam which organises the annual pilgrimage. The Defence Ministry has despatched helicopters to locate the missing and airlift the injured and the dead. Over 300 people, including 150 pilgrims, stranded at various points on their way to Mansarovar, are likely to be airlifted back to the plains following the disaster, according to official sources. The Control Rooms have been set up in Pithoragarh for monitoring relief and rescue work, and in Delhi, for providing information. Further landslides have reportedly caused more deaths in the region. ([OCHA, 20 Aug 1998](https://reliefweb.int/node/38930))\n\nThe United Nations Resident Coordinator in New Delhi, reports that the water level of some rivers in the Assam State is now receding and the flood situation is improving, with exception of the Salmara Mankachar sub-Division, in the Dhubri district, where the situation is still critical. Road and rail communications with the rest of the country are still cut off. In the Uttar Pradesh State, river Ghaghra was flowing 30 cms above danger level. According to the Ministry of Agriculture of India, as of 15 September 1998, floods affected approximately seven million hectares of land, of which some 3.3 million hectares of crops. As of 16 September 1998, approximately 36 million people have been affected, and about 3,000 people have been killed. Floods also affected seriously the housing sector, with about 852,000 houses partially/totally damaged. Some 74,000 animals have also been killed as a result of the floods.

    "description": "The onset of the monsoon in June triggered flash floods in the north and in July torrential rains brought further floods in south-eastern districts, causing widespread damage. The situation worsened from mid-July onwards as continuous rainfall in the great river catchment areas outside Bangladesh led to sharp rises in the water levels in most of the rivers flowing into the Jamuna (Brahmaputra), Meghna, and Padma (Ganges) basins. Crop lands, human habitats, roads, and even railway lines were inundated in district after district. Millions have been rendered homeless. Low-lying areas of Dhaka are under water and scores of villages along river banks have been engulfed by the floods. ([IFRC, 17 Aug 1998](https://reliefweb.int/node/38804))\n\nThe damage caused by the unusually prolonged floods was very extensive. Currently, the number of districts affected stands at 45 (out of a total of 64). The number of people affected by the floods is estimated at over 24 million, with 360 deaths reported due to drowning, snake bites and diseases. WHO has reported a widespread outbreak of water-borne diseases. Scores of villages along the riverbanks of the three major basins of Brahmaputra, Meghna and Padma and their tributaries have been engulfed by the floods. 353,000 houses have reportedly been destroyed, and 1.2 million damaged. The floods have also caused widespread damage to agriculture, spread over an area of 800,000 hectares of crops, and infrastructure, with 9,160 km of roads damaged, over 6,500 bridges and culverts washed away and 1,800 schools being affected, according to the Central Control Room of the Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief.

The Government mobilized all internal available resources to meet the need of the affected population. ([OCHA, 2 Jul 1998](https://reliefweb.int/node/37837))",

    "description": "Torrential rains have caused widespread destruction throughout Tajikistan. Rain began on 23 April and quickly wreaked havoc, destroying property, houses, infrastructures and crops. On 30 April , the government of Tajikistan requested assistance from the UN in mobilizing the international community to support national relief efforts. The Gharm district was affected by major landslides on 26 April . The town of Navdi suffered the most in terms of casualties and damage. Preliminary reports indicate 50 dead, 12 missing, 141 families homeless. 60 houses completely destroyed and 100 damaged. Other towns affected are Aini, Sakhrinav, Varzob and Konsomlobad. [...] Following government reports, agencies have visited the district, focusing on Kulyab area. Initial assessments indicate that 2,000 people are affected, 36 houses have been destroyed and 500 flood-damaged. Infrastructural damage include 7 bridges, Kulyab town sewage system, 20 electric pylons and a dam connected to water purification installations is near to collapse. 1,500 hectares of agricultural land have been flooded. Only one death has been reported in Kulyab. 400 people have been temporarily housed in public buildings or have been hosted by relatives. Further assessment is being conducted by UNOPS, Merlin and mission OST. Merlin reported that 4 boreholes which supply Kulyab town (100,000 people) are now contaminated with flood water and the river which supplies the southern towns of Moskovski and Pianj is also contaminated. Local medical authorities and Merlin are concerned that water borne epidemics could result. ([OCHA, 1 May 1998](https://reliefweb.int/node/37079))\n\nReports from the southern part of the country, Khatlon district, indicate that flooding in the area continues to endanger most of the population as water level rises. Although rain stopped on 4 May, the water level has not decreased and any further rain / meltwater will result in more population displacement. With rivers and channels already flooded and/or damaged, it is expected that the present conditions will continue for the coming weeks. [...] The most affected area is in/around SARVINE, in the VOSE district, where 3,000 people have been affected and two villages destroyed. IFRC also reported serious damages in MUMINABAD and KULYAB districts, where eight villages are flooded and 336 houses destroyed. Some areas are still reported inaccessible due to the collapse of bridges. [...] In the north-east of Tajikistan, Gharm district, there are no reports of new landslides. The Aga Khan Foundation reported that last week, in SHULONAK village, a landslide had killed seven people. Preliminary reports indicate major damage to crops. As rain is continuing, also the risk of additional landslides remains high. ([OCHA, 5 May 1998](https://reliefweb.int/node/37114))\n\nReports from the southern part of the country indicate that the most affected areas remain VOSE and KULYAB districts in the Khatlon region. New rains affected the area on the morning of 6 May. As a consequence, UNOPS reported a rise in water levels around Shartuis, south of Kurgan Teppah, close to the Afghan border. [...] In the north-east of Tajikistan, Gharm and Aini districts remain under the threat of new landslides. The Aga Khan Foundation has been requested to act as focal point for the collection of information. They reported that Navdi was the town requiring most assistance. Consolidated reports indicated that 70 families lost their homes, while 102 other had their houses damaged. In addition, 500 heads of livestock were killed, 15 km of power lines, 5 transformers, 6 km of roads, 4 bridges and 2 schools destroyed. ([OCHA, 8 May 1998](https://reliefweb.int/node/37168))\n\nHeavy rainfall in the night of 17 May 1998 and during the day of 18 May 1998 have once again flooded various areas of the country, including Dushanbe. The northern part of the city has seen severe damage. There are a total of 58 houses totally damaged in this area. The people have lost food, clothing, household items and furniture. They are now living with their relatives or neighbours, and some have moved to the mosques. The eastern part of Dushanbe has also seen some damages: a total of 4 houses have been totally destroyed. The Red Crescent Society of Tajikistan started with the distribution of non-food items on May 19. The road to the airport was covered with mud more than 0.5 meter thick; many other streets in the city were covered with mud. ([OCHA, 25 May 1998](https://reliefweb.int/node/37358))\n\nThe season of heavy rains is over and the flood-water of earlier this year has subsided. Tajik authorities and humanitarian organizations continue to provide relief to the victims of the flooding and landslides of this spring. Currently they are involved in initiatives aimed at controlling the effects of such floods in the future. There is, however, a threat of additional flooding along the bank of the Panj river, due to a high increase in the runoff of melting glaciers. [...] Fortunately the damage is limited to date. In Maskowski district, the village Sovchoz Turdiyev was evacuated for one night and 10 houses were damaged by the rising ground water. A bank enforcement and dam were also washed away.

In addition, approximately 3,000 houses have been washed away and hundreds of livestock have also been killed. An overall assessment of the damage is being conducted. [...] A review of the situation with the Cabinet Division (Emergency Relief Cell) in Islamabad suggests that the situation is now under control in terms of the immediate relief and supplies, while search and rescue operations are continuing. The Government has no intention of launching an international appeal for assistance as it considers the Provincial Government fully able to cope with the disaster and to carry out rehabilitation work once the emergency phase is over. ([OCHA, 5 Mar 1998](https://reliefweb.int/node/36383))\n\nUnprecedented rains wreaked havoc in the Turbat district of Balochistan province, western Pakistan, on 3 and 4 March 1998, causing flash floods along the Dasht river system that swept through more than 100 villages. The waters spread across entire river valleys, washing away houses, structures, irrigation systems and some 43,000 acres of standing crops. At least 300 people died in the disaster, while 4,000 homes were destroyed and another 8,000 were damaged. Altogether some 200,000 people in the area were affected by the disaster.

The water levels of various rivers and tributaries such as Ayeyarwady, Chindwin, Thanlwin, Sittaung, Kaladan and Bago have increased (in some cases, exceeded danger levels) affecting small villages, crop lands and habitats, and dislocating many people. According to unofficial figures: 31 persons dead, over 100 persons missing. Damage and losses have affected 109,029 households (767,439 persons) with housing submerged or washed away, large areas of cultivated crop land, and draught animals. Rural health centers also affected due to the inundation. ([UN DHA, 14 Aug 1997](https://reliefweb.int/node/32045))\n\nThe flooding in Myanmar has affected nine of Myanmar's fourteen States and Divisions, with Mon State, and Bago and Ayeyarwaddy Divisions being worst hit. Official figures for these three administrative units indicate 68 deaths, with 103,650 persons from 20,851 households being affected: 35,173 persons (6,636 households) in Mon State, 33,768 persons (6,639 households) in Bago Division, and 34,709 persons (7,576 households) in Ayeyarwaddy Division. ([UN DHA, 26 Aug 1997](https://reliefweb.int/node/32221))\n\nIn Bilin 5 wards and 18 villages were submerged, affecting 33,191 persons from 6,387 households. 5 persons drowned. Out of the 7 Health clinics, 5 were flooded. 200 persons from 46 households in Natkyee were rendered homeless. 60,000 acres of paddyland were submerged under water, out of which 7,300 were totally destroyed. Of the destroyed acres, only 5,000 are replantable, the rest has been eroded. In Kyaikhto 16 villages consisting of 1,925 households were flooded, out of which 258 heavily affected. On 3 August a landslide buried a Kayin buddhist village (Saung Naing Gyi) two miles away from Kyaikhto. All 120 households were either washed away or buried under the debris. 533 people were affected by the landslide and 16 persons perished. The village is now being resettled at a place close to the previous village. Out of the cultivated 12,240 acres, 6,639 were totally destroyed. Rehabilitation of the destroyed farmland is under way.

    "description": "The DHA/UNDP Resident Representative reports on damage caused by heavy rains in the State of Gujarat. According to the latest official reports, 111 people have been killed by floods. Some 200,000 houses have been damaged. The extent of loss of crops and cattle is being assessed. The floods have affected the Districts of Mehsana, Gandhi Nagar, Ahmedabad, Kheda, Sabarkanda, Vadodra, Banaskanda and Surender Nagar in the State of Gujarat. Communication links, including roads and railways, have been badly affected. Most of the villages are cut off and army helicopters have been dropping food packets for isolated people. ([UN DHA, 2 Jul 1997](https://reliefweb.int/node/31328))\n\nIncessant and torrential monsoon rains, beginning in late July, have inundated large areas of Midnapore district in West Bengal, India. An estimated 16,000 houses have collapsed due to the flooding caused by the heavy rains and approximately 100,000 people are homeless. In addition, drinking water sources, roads, embankments, infrastructure and croplands have been extensively damaged or destroyed. There are immediate and acute needs of vulnerable familes for food, temporary shelter, and assistance in rebuilding their homes. ([CWS, 3 Sep 1997](https://reliefweb.int/node/32398))",

    "description": "From the early morning of 8 May to 9 May 1997, heavy rains poured down in Guangzhou, Qingyuan, Heyuan, and Yunfu of Guangdong Province. In the opinion of scientists, this type of rainfall only occurs every 500 years. The intensive rainfall led to severe mountain floods in some areas, water level of the rivers were fast increasing, villages and farmland were inundated and houses collapsed. According to incomplete statistics, 22 counties/cities with a population of 1.36 million were affected, 110 people died and 21 are missing, 1,354 people were injured, 177 villages were inundated, and 77,000 people had to be evacuated. 19,000 housing units collapsed and 56,000 were damaged. ([UN DHA, 15 May 1997](https://reliefweb.int/node/30562))\n\nThe floodwaters that plague China every year have begun to spread across its southern and eastern regions as the monsoon made its dramatic seasonal debut in Hong Kong on 1 July. At least 12 provinces are now experiencing flooding although waters have not reached disaster proportions in all as of yet. Most severely affected are those in the Pearl River catchment area, including its tributaries the Xijiang and Beijiang Rivers. The affected provinces include Hong Kong, Shanghai, Sichuan, Hubei, Hunan, Zhejing, Yunnan, Guizhou, Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian, and Jiangxi. More than 70 people have already died in the flooding. Over 14 million people are currently affected by the floods through death, injury, destruction to homes, inundation of farmland, closure of factories and damage to infrastructure. Approximately 1,000 people had to be evacuated from the Beijing-Kowloon passenger train when a landslide blocked its passage. As floodwaters rose, rail travel between Shanghai and Fujian Province was suspended due to water-covered tracks and weakened trestles. ([IFRC, 14 Jul 1997](https://reliefweb.int/node/32005))",

    "description": "Since end of August 1996, there have been heavy rains in the upper catchment areas of the Mekong River in Lao PDR and Cambodia, causing high water levels downstream in Vietnam. According to the hydro-meteorological services of the Vietnamese government, as of 1 October 1996, the water levels of the river in Vietnam are rising fast. The government predicts that the water levels will possibly crest on about 7 to 17 October 1996. Due to the latest flooding in the southern provinces of An Giang and Dong Thap, 3 children were killed and about 1,000 households had to be evacuated. Damages to roads, medical facilities and dikes have also been reported. The central government urgently requested the southern provinces of An Giang, Dong Thap, Long An, Vinh Long, Tra Vinh, Ben Tre and Tien Giang (situated along the Mekong River) to undertake all necessary activities for flooding control and reducing damages. As for the northern provinces which were hit by the earlier floods, the emergency grants provided by DHA and the Nippon Foundation (USD 50,000 in total) are being disbursed to locally procure medicine, food, cooking materials, clothes, blankets, etc., which are to be delivered to some districts of Nghe An, Ha Tinh and Thanh Hoa provinces. ([UN DHA, 4 Oct 1996](https://reliefweb.int/node/32321))\n\nAs of 24 October, due to the flooding in the southern provinces of An Giang, Dong Thap, Tay Minh, Long An, Tien Giang, Kien Giang, Can Tho and Vinh Long, 96 people have been reported killed. More than 600,000 houses were submerged, 56,000 of which were damaged and 1,560 collapsed. 30,000 households had to be evacuated. About 80,000 ha of rice crop have been lost, 50,000 ha of fruit tree gardens and 27,000 ha of fish shrimp ponds were submerged, and 589,000 heads of livestock/ poultry were lost. Severe damage has been reported to river dikes and earth canal embankments, and infrastructure of various sectors, including education and public health. Extensive damage to transportation has also been reported, such as 840 km of national and district roads submerged, 8,000 km of local roads submerged, and 20,000 culverts and small bridges damaged. The government has estimated economic losses incurred by the flooding in the southern provinces at USD 101 million (VND 1,112 billion). ([UN DHA, 25 Oct 1996](https://reliefweb.int/node/32302))\n\nAs at 3 November, coupled with damages resulted from another tropical low pressure storm of 21 October and following heavy rains from 22 October to 1 November affecting central provinces Of Thua Thien-Hue, Quang Nam - Da Nang and Quang Tri, more than 60 human lives have been lost. A large number of houses, many parts of major and local roads and other infrastructure have been submerged. Within one month, Hue city has been submerged three times. Many places were submerged from 1.5 to 1.8 meters deep. Some towns were entirely isolated for several days, such as the town of Kham Duc which was isolated for 8 days. In mountainous areas, heavy rains caused flash floods, damaging rice fields currently being harvested. [\u2026] According to CCFSC's consolidated damage assessment report, between 29 September and 2 November, 162 lives have been lost. More than 750,000 houses have been submerged, of which 149,000 houses have been damaged and 317 houses have collapsed. More than 26,000 hectares of rice field have been destroyed, and more than 800,000 heads of livestock have been lost. Extensive damage to irrigation canals has been reported. Total economic loss has been estimated to be USD 138 million (VND 1,508 billion). ([UN DHA, 8 Nov 1996](https://reliefweb.int/node/33394))",

    "description": "In the last ten days of September, heavy rainfall produced by two storms in China, Laos, and the north-east of Cambodia caused a rapid and extraordinary rise in the level of the Mekong River. The result was widespread flooding across six provinces in Cambodia (Ratanakiri, Stung Treng, Kampong Cham, Kandal and Prey Veng) with the most serious flooding occurring in Kampong Cham and Prey Veng. Some districts of Phnom Penh have also been affected as the Mekong nears the critical level of 11.20 metres in the capital. ([IFRC, 1 Oct 1996](https://reliefweb.int/node/27305))\n\nAs the flooding recedes in the six provinces and districts of Phnom Penh along the Mekong river, four other Cambodian provinces have become inundated. In Svay Rieng 10,453 people were affected by floods caused by a freak combination of receding flood waters from upstream provinces and high tides in Vietnam that forced water back into Cambodia. In Takeo, a heavy thunderstorm caused flooding affecting 60,506 people. In Banteay Meanchey in the NW, heavy rains and water run off from Thailand have affected 5,555 people, while in Pursat water run-off from the swollen Tonle Sap has affected 1,465 people. The floods have reportedly claimed 59 lives, damaged 130,577 hectares of rice fields, and left an estimated 584,700 people in need of assistance.

When the flood struck at 8.00 hrs in the morning, most people were away from their homes working in shops or in the fields. This was the first major natural disaster to hit Bhutan in over two decades. The high casualty level in this sparsely populated country makes the flood the worst in the written record.

    "description": "Unusually heavy monsoon rains since 7 July 1993 have caused widespread flooding in northern states of India, with Punjab, Haryana and Himachal Pradesh being hardest hit. Flash floods, landslides, overflow of rivers and irrigation canals have inflicted a high death toll and severe damage to housing, agriculture and infrastructure. Several areas remain isolated from the rest of the country as transport and communication links have been cut. According to unconfirmed preliminary reports the death toll reached 178 as of 13 July 1993. It is estimated that in Punjab about 10 million people, i.e. approximately half of the population are affected. ([UN DHA, 16 Jul 1993](https://reliefweb.int/node/35051))\n\nSeveral states in India continue to remain affected by heavy rains and waves of floods. A total of 489 deaths have been reported in the states of Punjab (271), Gujarat (94), Himachal Pradesh (42), Haryana (36), Jammu and Kashmir (20), Rajasthan (19), Madhya Pradesh (6) and Chandigarh (1). Three days of torrential rain flooded vast stretches in western assam and Jalpaiguri town in West Bengal. North-eastern areas remain cut off as road/rail links are inundated with water and bridges have been washed away or flooded. Drinking water supply disrupted in many locations due to flooding of pumping stations. Millions of people had to take refuge in emergency camps in Punjab and the north-east. More than 10,000 cattle heads reported lost in Punjab (5,752) Himachal Pradesh (4,600), Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh. ([UN DHA, 23 Jul 1993](https://reliefweb.int/node/35051))\n\nOverall conditions in northern region have further improved, with fall in levels of major rivers, while relief measures continue in flood-affected areas. Press reports highest death toll of 323 in Punjab, 50 in Haryana, 47 in Himachal Pradesh, 2 in Chandigarh, about 200 in West Bengal, 117 in Gujarat, 39 in Jammu and Kashmir, 24 in assam, 19 in Rajasthan and 6 in Madhya Pradesh. Total 827. Est. Total population affected is over 128 million people. First assessment of overall damage to crops, housing and public utilities is over USD 700 million.

The worst affected area appears to be Azad Kashmir. Over 2,000 people have been reported killed, roads and many bridges are damaged. Agricultural land and crops are seriously affected. The damage is described as enormous. Government authorities at all levels are undertaking emergency operations. The UN Resident Coordinator has convened the Disaster Management Team, consisting of government, UN and other donor representatives, who are working on a preliminary assessment of damage and needs. The government has not yet issued an appeal for international assistance. ([UN DHA, 15 Sep 1992](https://reliefweb.int/node/36031))\n\nThe intensity of rainfall was highest ever recorded in sub-continent. Unprecedented high flows recorded in catchment areas of rivers Jhelum and Chenab similarly, severe damages reported in Azad Kashmir and northern areas. The high flood water now heading towards Sindh province. Worst of disaster may yet come as flood waters move south and threaten to destroy headworks which control flow five main rivers in the country. Exact numbers of human casualties not yet known, since flooding still continuing. Preliminary official estimates are over 700 people dead of which 143 in Punjab, with many still missing. Other, usually reliable sources put the death toll at over 2,000. Karakuram highway linking Pakistan with China badly damaged and closed for traffic.

More rainfall and thunderstorms are expected and the floods are still spreading south to Sindh. Nearly 2 million people have been affected and an area of more than 3 million acres is flooded. Around 56,000 houses have been demolished and another 20,000 damaged. The number of deaths is now estimated at over 2,000. Numerous bridges and roads particularly in the northwestern frontier province have been destroyed and the damage to crops (cotton) runs into hundreds of millions of dollars. The army continues to assist the local authorities with emergency relief and tents, blankets, clothes and food have been distributed.

    "description": "Heavy rains caused by Tropical Storm Uring which struck central Philippines on 5 November 1991 resulted in devastating flash floods in islands of Negros and Leyte. Assessment of damage and needs by local authorities is still underway. Electricity and communications not operational in affected areas. Initial reports provided by Central Office of Civil Defense (OCD) yield following data: casualties: dead 2,155, injured 37, missing 312 (an additional 1,800 persons are unconfirmed missing); population affected: 177,786; damage: 12 bridges totally or partially destroyed. ([UN DHA, 7 Nov 1991](https://reliefweb.int/node/35092))\n\nAccording to local authorities, the effects of storm 'Uring' (international code 'Thelma') were further compounded by extensive denudation of hillsides which caused floods and landslides. Worst hit was Ormoc Port (120,000 inhabitants) on west coast of Leyte island, some 560 km (340 miles) southeast of Manila, which was ravaged by water-borne debris and mud. ([UN DHA, 7 Nov 1991](https://reliefweb.int/node/35092))\n\nDeath toll increasing as more bodies retrieved, many of which from flood-swept islands off Ormoc. Exact number to be verified, since people buried relatives without informing authorities. [\u2026] In Ormoc alone, 3,009 people died and 2,012 are missing, relatively low number of injured reflects sudden nature and strength of the floods, which reached height up to ten feet. [\u2026] In Leyte, 12 municipalities are affected and still without electricity. Roads and dams are heavily damaged, 12 bridges are destroyed. In Negros Occidental, six municipalities and three cities are affected, two bridges are destroyed, one bridge damaged. ([UN DHA, 11 Nov 1991](https://reliefweb.int/node/35092))\n\nOn return from mission to Ormoc, UNDRO delegate reported that with financial support from Presidency, local authorities repaired 70 percent of electricity and, with assistance from technical team dispatched by JICA (Japan International Co-operation Agency), 60 percent of water supply system. Food and medical care are regularly provided (one suspected case of cholera under strict surveillance). JICA's medical team completed two-week operations.9 out of 45 damaged bridges now passable and it is hoped that all damaged infrastructure in Ormoc will be restored by early 1992. Following verification, toll of deaths officially recorded is now at 3,840 (plus 2,000 missing). 3,050 people are injured. ([UN DHA, 22 Nov 1991](https://reliefweb.int/node/35092))",

    "description": "In northern Myanmar, Irrawaddy river started to rise 10 July rendering 15,000 persons (3,000 families) homeless in Sagaing Administrative Division. Local authorities have relocated affected population to towns on higher ground. ([UN DHA, 19 Jul 1991](https://reliefweb.int/node/35863))\n\nTorrential rains since 13 July, have caused Chindwin river in northern Myanmar to exceed its danger level by 346 cm, thus eroding river banks and flooding parts of Sagaing Adm. Division.  UNDRO/UNDP Representative reports 3,212 households affected and 17,570 people relocated to higher ground where 9 relief camps opened by local authorities. ([UN DHA, 26 Jul 1991](https://reliefweb.int/node/35864))\n\nGovt of Myanmar reports dykes of Ayeyarwady river in Ayeyarwady Division some 150 km from Yangon have broken and vast area including 388,000 acres of cultivated land, has been inundated with average depth of water 1 meter. 12 communities with 50,852 households comprising 239,000 people affected. Initial damage assessment includes partial or full destruction of over 20,000 family homes. Infrastructure in area damaged with several kilometers railway stretch washed away. Floods will prevent rice producing communities to harvest their paddy this season thus creating a need for medium term rehabilitation assistance to follow immediately after emergency relief programme. Provisional estimates see harvest from 370,000 acres rice paddy and 18,000 acres jute as lost. ([UN DHA, 14 Aug 1991](https://reliefweb.int/node/35864))\n\nHteingu embankment in Laymyatnar township in Ayeyarwady was breached on 28 July 1991 due to swelling of Ayeyarwady and Ngawun rivers resulting from incessant heavy rains since 13 July from western Yoma mountains and unusually high tides. Area of damaged embankment is over 1,000 ft. Long and 30 ft. Wide. Hteingu flood inundated 9 townships with 1,481 villages, 83,753 house-holds and 359,976 inhabitants, 23 fatalities were recorded. 4 hospitals, 32 rural health centres, 586 schools, 74,740 houses and 254,227 acres of cultivated land were flooded. [\u2026] As regard health situation, outbreak of 4,573 cases of diarrhoea, 13,120 respiratory cases and malaria and 4 cases of snake bite patients reported. Local health authorities claim that malaria will spread at accelerating rate in very near future especially if water does not recede, since this particular area of Ayeyarwady is malaria infested. Snake bite and cholera/hepatitis is of increasing concern. ([UN DHA, 4 Sep 1991](https://reliefweb.int/node/35864))",

# 📁 triples/

This folder contains all structured triples extracted from flood-related data sources. These triples are later ingested into a knowledge graph to support semantic querying and comparison across events.

---

## 📂 Subfolders

- `triples_from_text/` – Contains `.txt` files with triples extracted from **textual descriptions** of disasters (e.g., ReliefWeb reports).  
- `triples_from_images/` – Contains `.txt` files with triples extracted from **satellite images**, including RGB (visual), NDWI, and NIR types.

### 📝 Example: Triples from Text Modality

Below is a real example of structured triples automatically extracted from a **textual report** describing a recent flood in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (April 2025). Each triple captures a fact about the event, grounded in the source document:

```txt

```
### 🛰️ Example: Triples from Image Modality (NDWI)

This example shows triples extracted from the **NDWI satellite image** for a 2024 flood in Algeria. These triples describe visual patterns in water saturation, land cover, and flood indicators visible in the image:

```txt
(FL-2024-000024-DZA, hasndwiimage, FL-2024-000024-DZA-ndwi)
(FL-2024-000024-DZA-ndwi, showsFeature, waterBody)  
(FL-2024-000024-DZA-ndwi, showsFeature, drySurface)  
(FL-2024-000024-DZA-ndwi, hasLandCover, saturatedLand)  
(FL-2024-000024-DZA-ndwi, hasLandCover, bareSoil)

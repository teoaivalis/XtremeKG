# üìÅ triples/

This folder contains all structured triples extracted from flood-related data sources. These triples are later ingested into a knowledge graph to support semantic querying and comparison across events.

## üìÇ Subfolders

- `triples_from_text/` ‚Äì Contains `.txt` files with triples extracted from **textual descriptions** of disasters (e.g., ReliefWeb reports).  
- `triples_from_images/` ‚Äì Contains `.txt` files with triples extracted from **satellite images**, including RGB (visual), NDWI, and NIR types.

Each file corresponds to a single flood event and contains a list of triples in the form:

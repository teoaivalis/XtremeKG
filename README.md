## üìù Abstract

The increasing frequency and severity of climate-related disasters call for more interpretable and actionable insights from Earth Observation (EO) data. In this work, we propose a novel framework that leverages multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) to construct structured Knowledge Graphs (KGs) from heterogeneous disaster-related sources, including satellite imagery, textual reports, and geospatial metadata. By grounding these data streams in a domain-specific ontology, we produce semantically rich, human-aligned representations of extreme events, enabling transparent reasoning and flexible querying across spatial, temporal, and socio-economic dimensions. We demonstrate the utility of our system through a detailed case study on flood events, supported by quantitative evaluations of the extracted triples and example KG-based queries. Our results show that this approach enables interpretable comparisons of disaster events, supports informed planning, and provides a reusable interface for downstream analysis in climate resilience and emergency response.

## üìà System Architecture

The diagram below shows the end-to-end pipeline that transforms multimodal disaster data into structured Knowledge Graphs. It combines text and satellite imagery, uses an ontology for semantic alignment, and employs LLMs with retrieval-augmented generation to extract high-quality triples for robust event analysis.
